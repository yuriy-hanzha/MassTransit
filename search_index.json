is MassTransit?\nMassTransit is a free, open-source distributed application framework for .NET. MassTransit makes it easy to create applications and services that leverage message-based, loosely-coupled asynchronous communication for higher availability, reliability, and scalability.\nMassTransit sits on top of several widely supported message transports and provides an extensive set of features resulting in a developer-friendly approach to build asynchronous services using message-based conversation patterns. Message-based communication is a reliable and scalable way to implement a service oriented architecture.\nGetting started\nTo get started using MassTransit, check out the Quick Start.\nGetting help\nMassTransit has a simple and approachable API, however, distributed application development is inherently complex. If you have questions, concerns, or issues using MassTransit, please visit the Getting help page to find a list of useful resources.\nA bit of the back story? \nWe are often asked why MassTransit was created, well here’s the story. :)\nIn 2007, Chris Patterson (@phatboyg) and Dru Sellers (@drusellers) met at the first ALT.NET conference in Austin, TX. It was at this conference that Chris and Dru not only realized that they had a lot of the same problems to solve, but also how much the standard tooling provided by Microsoft just didn't fit their needs. Surrounded by the best and brightest in .NET, the energy was there to build better tooling that supported testable processes. Combined with an awareness of the latest advances in tooling, libraries, and coding practices; they decided that a better option must exist. After searching the .NET ecosystem for a tool that would help them achieve their goals, the only real option was the venerable NServiceBus. After reviewing NServiceBus, it was determined that the only real dependency injection container supported was Spring.NET. It also became obvious that NServiceBus wasn't quite ready for external contributors to come onboard. For these reasons, they decided to embark on the quixotic trek of building their own service bus (seriously, how hard could it be?? LOL).\nInitially the goals were as much about learning distributed message based systems, as well as building something both of their companies could use. The first commit was pushed to GoogleCode on 12/26/2007, and shortly there after both Dru and Chris went to production with MassTransit and both of their companies have had success in getting value out of their efforts.\nAfter four years of continued success, Chris and Dru continued to push forward on their Journey, and were joined by Travis Smith (@TravisTheTechie). The near future should bring much for the MassTransit community as RabbitMQ became the broker of choice, lessening the focus on MSMQ.\nIn early 2014, after a few years of research and design, work was started on an entirely new MassTransit. In order to embrace the world of asynchronous programming, as well as leveraging the power of advanced messaging platforms like RabbitMQ, a foundational rewrite was required. Much of the code in MassTransit was written prior to the introduction of the Task Parallel Library (or TPL), and even the .NET 4.0 support was before async and await were added to the language.\nTo eliminate a ton of extremely complex code, support for MSMQ was completely ripped out, including all of the routing support that had to be built because of MSMQ’s lack of message routing. The remaining code was rewritten from bottom to top, resulting in an entirely new, completely asynchronous, and highly optimized framework for message processing.\nThe philosophy\nFirst and foremost, we are not an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). While MassTransit is used in several enterprises it isn’t a swiss army knife, we are not driven by sales to be a million features wide, and an inch deep. We focus on a few key concepts and try to make them as robust as possible.\nWe don’t do doodleware, you won’t find a designer, we are all about the keyboard samurais, the true in-the-trenches coder. That’s who we are, and those are our friends. If you want to draw, use a whiteboard.\nWe don’t do FTP->WS-deathstar->BS (not that you can’t, it just isn't in the box). We focus on the experience of using one transport in a given environment, and we try to make it as smooth as possible.\nMassTransit is built to be used inside the firewall, it isn't built to be used as a means to communicate with external vendors (it can be, again it just isn't in the box), it's meant to be used for getting your corporate services talking to each other and making building internal software easier.\n"},"quickstart.html":{"url":"quickstart.html","title":"Quick Start","keywords":"","body":"Getting started\nTo get started using MassTransit, create a console application using:\nmkdir GettingStarted\ndotnet new console -o GettingStarted\nAdd some references to the newly created console application:\ncd GettingStarted\ndotnet add package MassTransit.RabbitMQ\nAt this point, the project should compile, but there is more work to be done.\nShow me the code!\n\nYou can view a working project on GitHub.\n\nA bare bones Program.cs is shown below, just to get started.\npublic class YourMessage\n{ \n    public string Text { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        var bus = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(sbc =>\n        {\n            var host = sbc.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost\"), h =>\n            {\n                h.Username(\"guest\");\n                h.Password(\"guest\");\n            });\n\n            sbc.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"test_queue\", ep =>\n            {\n                ep.Handler(context =>\n                {\n                    return Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($\"Received: {context.Message.Text}\");\n                });\n            });\n        });\n\n        bus.Start(); // This is important!\n\n        bus.Publish(new YourMessage{Text = \"Hi\"});\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit\");\n        Console.ReadKey();\n\n        bus.Stop();\n    }\n}\n\nWhat is this doing?\nIf we are going to create a messaging system, we need to create a message. YourMessage is a .NET class that will represent our message. Notice that it's just a Plain Old CLR Object (or POCO).\nNext up, we need a program to run our code. Here we have a standard issue command line Main method. To setup the bus we start with the static class Bus and work off of the Factory extension point. From there we call the CreateUsingRabbitMQ method to setup a RabbitMQ bus instance. This method takes a lambda whose first and only argument is a class that will let you configure every aspect of the bus.\nOne of your first decisions is going to be \"What transport do I want to run on?\" Here we have chosen RabbitMQ (Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMQ()) because its the defacto transport choice for MassTransit.\nAfter that we need to configure the RabbitMQ host settings sbc.Host(). The first argument sets the machine name and the virtual directory to connect to. After that you have a lambda that you can use to tweak any of the other settings that you want. Here we can see it setting the username and password.\nNow that we have a host to listen on, we can configure some receiving endpoints sbc.ReceiveEndpoint. We pass in the host connection to listen on, then which queue do we want to listen on, and finally a lambda to register each handler that we want to use.\nLastly, in the configuration, we have the Handler method which subscribes a handler for the message type YourMessage and takes an async lambda (oh yeah baby TPL) that is given a context class to process. Here we access the message by traversing context.Message and then writing to the console the text of the message.\nAnd now we have a bus instance that is fully configured and can start processing messages. We can grab the busControl that we created and call Start on it to get everything rolling. We again await on the result and now we can go.\n\nImportant you need to start the bus, otherwise you will get issues with sending and receiving messages. There is no \"send-only\" bus with MassTransit.\n\nWe can call the Publish method on the busControl and we should see our console write the output.\n"},"introduction/getting-help.html":{"url":"introduction/getting-help.html","title":"Getting Help","keywords":"","body":"Getting Help\nWriting distributed applications is hard, and sometimes you need help. There are several ways to get in touch with the developers behind MassTransit. In most cases, you can expect a response within a few days, sometimes sooner. The speed of the response is going to depend upon how well you've done your homework before raising the white flag.\nHowever, before attempting to contact a developer directly, there are many active forums for support that are available.\nStack Overflow\nThere is a MassTransit tag on Stack Overflow, which has many questions that have already been asked. Several developers regularly monitor this tag for new questions, so that's a great place to start. Be sure to search and see if your question has already been asked, that is the fastest way to an answer if someone else has already experienced the same issue.\nBefore you just post your question, however, spend a few moments to compose your thoughts and formulate your question. There is nothing as pointless as simply telling us \"MassTransit does not work for me\" with no further information to give any clue to why. Before you post, search the web to see if your question has already been asked or even answered. And if it has been, you will already have your answer.\nMailing List\nA long history of support is available on the mailing list, which is hosted on Google Groups. There are a wide variety of developers using MassTransit on the list, and often times they can help. If you are going to use MassTransit, joining the mailing list is a great way to participate in the community.\nWhen posting on the mailing list, pick a good subject line, and if the subject of the thread changes, please change the subject to match. Some of us deal with hundreds of emails per day and we need all the help we can get to pick the interesting or important ones.\nAlso, if you are seeing some unexpected behavior, generate a diagnostic result and post it as a Gist so that it can be reviewed (mail attachments rarely work, so avoid them). This will help a lot towards understanding how your configuration is setup.\nGitter\nOur chat room at Gitter is becoming more and more popular. There you can find people who use MassTransit in their systems and can provide you with quick advise. Get engaged, get help and help others too!\nTwitter\nA fast way to get our attention is on Twitter, by shooting a tweet tagged #mtproj. Assuming you can fit your question in 140 characters or less. A few of us have saved searches on this tag, which makes questions easy to find (strangely, MassTransit is the worst term to search -- go figure). There are several spread out across the US, so think about the time zone when you tweet. Again, post a link to a Gist with source, configuration, log files, etc. If it is complex, it's likely you'll be pushed to hit the mailing list.\nGitHub Issues\nPlease do not open an issue on GitHub, unless you have spotted an actual bug in MassTransit. If you are unsure, ask on the mailing list or on StackOverflow, and if we confirm it's a bug, we'll ask you to create the issue. \nIssues are not the place for questions, and they'll likely be closed.\nThis policy is in place to avoid bugs being drowned out in a pile of sensible suggestions for future enhancements and calls for help from people who forget to check back if they get it and so on.\n"},"understand/":{"url":"understand/","title":"Understanding MassTransit","keywords":"","body":"Understanding MassTransit\nMassTransit is a large framework, and there is a lot going on under the hood.

To ensure that you are on the right path when looking at a class or interface, here are some of the terms used when working with MassTransit.\nMessage contracts\nA message contract defines a contract between a message producer and a message consumer. In MassTransit, message contracts are declared using types, which should be interfaces in .NET, but may also be classes. For example, a simple command contract for submitting an order is shown below.\npublic interface SubmitOrder\n{\n    Guid OrderId { get; }\n    DateTimeOffset SubmitDate { get; }\n    string OrderNumber { get; }\n    OrderItem[] Items { get; }\n}\n\npublic interface OrderItem \n{\n    string ItemNumber { get; }\n    int Quantity { get; }\n}\n\nSerialization\nMassTransit is a service bus, and a service bus is designed to move messages. At the lowest level, a message is a byte array (byte[]) which may represent JSON, XML, or encrypted data.\nWhen sending a message, MassTransit uses a message serializer to convert message contract instances (objects) into JSON, XML, or whatever output format is generated by the serializer. When receiving that message, a message deserializer is used to convert the formatted data back into the message contract.\nBy default, MassTransit uses JSON to serialize messages, while simultaneously suppporting the deserialization of JSON, BSON, and XML messages. Additional deserializers can be added, and the serializer can be changed for each receive endpoint or the entire bus.\nTo specify that XML should be used when sending messages:\nBus.Factory.CreateUsingInMemory(cfg =>\n{\n    cfg.UseXmlSerializer();\n});\n\nOther serializers can be configured using other configuration methods.\nConsumers\nConsumers are classes used to consume messages. Conceptually they are similar to Controllers in a Web API, in that consumers implement a generic interface to specify the message types to be consumed.\nAn example consumer that consumes the sample message contract above is shown below.\npublic class SubmitOrderConsumer :\n    IConsumer\n{\n    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        // do the thing\n    }\n}\n\nConsumers are stateless by design, and MassTransit makes no effort to correlate messages to a specific consumer instance. For each message, a consumer factory is used to create a consumer instance to which that message is delivered.\nSagas\nIn MassTransit, a saga is a stateful consumer that allows multiple messages to be correlated to a single consumer instance. A saga, sometimes called a workflow, is typically used to orchestrate other consumers or services in a distributed system while maintaining state between messages. MassTransit persists a saga's state using a saga repository, and automatically creates a new or uses an existing state instance as messages are received.\n\nConsider a saga a long-running transaction that is managed at the application layer instead of being handled inside a database or by a distributed transaction coordinator.\n\nMassTransit supports simple class-based sagas and powerful, advanced state machine sagas using Automatonymous - a declarative state machine library. In a class-based saga, messages are correlated using a Guid CorrelationId property and must implement the CorrelatedBy interface. Class-based sagas can also observe messages by specifying a correlation expression, but caution should be used to avoid matching a message to hundreds of saga instances which may cause performance issues. \nA simple saga is shown below as an example, which monitors the completion time of orders.\npublic class OrderToCompletionSaga :\n    ISaga,\n    InitiatedBy,\n    Orchestrates\n{\n    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }\n    public DateTime Submitted { get; set; }\n    public DateTime Completed { get; set; }\n\n    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        Submitted = context.Message.OrderDate;\n    }\n\n    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        Completed = context.Message.CompletionDate;\n    }\n}\n\nTransports and endpoints\nMassTransit is a framework, and being a framework has certain rules. The first of which is known as the Hollywood principle -- \"Don't call us, we'll call you.\" Once the bus is configured and running, message consumer are called by the framework as messages are received. There is no need for the application to poll a message queue or make repeated calls to a framework method in a loop.\n\nNote:\nA way to understand this is to think of a message consumer as being similar to a controller in a web application. With a web application, the socket and HTTP protocol are under the hood, and the controller is created and an action method is called by the web framework. MassTransit is similar, it handles the message reception, creates the consumers, and calls the Consume method.\n\n\nTo initiate the calls into your application code, MassTransit creates an abstraction on top of the messaging platform (such as RabbitMQ).\nTransports\nThe transport is at the lowest level and is closest to the actual message broker. The transport communicates with the broker, responsible for sending and receiving messages. The send and receive sections of the transport are completely independent, keeping reads and writes separate in line with the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern.\nReceive endpoints\nA receive endpoint receives messages from a transport, deserializes the message body, and routes the message to the consumers. Applications do not interact with receive endpoints, other than to configure and connect consumers. The rest of the work is done entirely by MassTransit.\nSend endpoints\nA send endpoint is used by an application to send a message to a specific address. They can be obtained from the ConsumeContext or the IBus and support a variety of message types.\nEndpoint addressing\nMassTransit uses Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) to identify endpoints. URIs are flexible and easy to include additional information, such as queue or exchange types. An example RabbitMQ endpoint address for my_queue on the local machine would be: rabbitmq://localhost/my_queue\n"},"understand/under-the-hood.html":{"url":"understand/under-the-hood.html","title":"Under the hood","keywords":"","body":"Under the hood\nMassTransit hides all the details of messages and delivery from the developer.\nHowever, when there are issues it is important to know how it works so you can troubleshoot the issues.\nSetup\nTo see how this plays out, consider the following message types:\nnamespace MySystem.Messages {\n    interface SomeMessage {}\n}\n\nConfigure the bus that will listen to SomeMessage with an endpoint of my_endpoint.\nStarting a bus\nWhen creating the endpoint above you indicated the name of the queue where the messages will end up.\nSee queue naming rules below.  Starting the bus with the consumers registered, causes the following configuration to happen:\n\nA queue named my_endpointis created for all messages on this endpoint\nAn exchange named my_endpoint is created for all messages on this endpoint\nAn exchange named MySystem.Messages.SomeMessageis created for the message\nAn exchange to exchange binding from MySystem.Messages.SomeMessage to my_endpoint is created\nA binding from the my_endpoint exchange to my_endpoint queue is created.\n\n\nNote:\n    All exchanges created are of type FanOut\n\n\nPublishing a message\nWhen you publish a message on the bus here is what happens:\n\nPublish MySystem.Messages.SomeMessage\nThis message gets published by the publishing logic to the exchange MySystem.Messages.SomeMessage\nThe message is routed by messaging infrastructure to the my_endpoint exchange\nThe message is then routed to the my_endpoint queue\n\n\nNote:\nIf you publish a message before the consumer has been started (and created its configuration), the exchange\nMySystem.Messages.SomeMessage will be created. It will not be bound to anything until the consumer starts,\nso if you publish to it, the message will just disappear.\n\n\nQueues\n\nEach application you write should use a unique queue name.\nIf you run multiple copies  of your consumer service, they would listen to the same queue (as they are copies).\nThis would mean you have multiple applications listening to my_endpoint queue\nThis would result in a 'competing consumer' scenario.  (Which is what you want if you run same service multiple times)\nIf there is an exception from your consumer, the message will be sent to my_endpoint_error queue.\nIf a message is received in a queue that the consumer does not know how to handle, the message will be sent to my_endpoint_skipped queue.\n\nDesign Benefits\n\nAny application can listen to any message and that will not affect any other application that may or may not be listening for that message\nAny application(s) that bind a group of messages to the same queue will result in the competing consumer pattern.\nYou do not have to concern yourself with anything but what message type to produce and what message type to consume.\n\nFaq\n\nHow many messages at a time will be simultaneously processed?\n\nEach endpoint you create represents 1 queue.  That queue can receive any number of different message types (based on what you subscribe to it)\nThe configuration of each endpoint you can set the number of consumers with a call to PrefetchCount(x).\nThis is the total number of consumers for all message types sent to this queue.\nIn MT2, you had to add ?prefetch=X to the Rabbit URL. This is handled automatically now.\n\n\nCan I have a set number of consumers per message type?\n\nYes. This uses middleware.\nx.Consumer(new AutofacConsumerFactory(), p => p.UseConcurrencyLimit(1));  x.PrefetchCount=16;\n PrefetchCount should be relatively high, a multiple of your concurrency limit for all message types so that RabbitMQ doesn't choke delivery messages due to network delays. Always have a queue ready to receive the message.\n\n\n\nWhen my consumer is not running, I do not want the messages to wait in the queue.  How can I do this?\n\nThere are two ways.  Note that each of these imply you would never use a 'competing consumer' pattern, so make sure that is the case.\nSet PurgeOnStartup=true in the endpoint configuration. When the bus starts, it will empty the queue of all messages.\nSet AutoDelete=true in the endpoint configuration. This causes the queue to be removed when your application stops.\n\n\n\n\nHow are Retries handled?\n\nThis is handled by middleware. Each endpoint has a retry policy.\n\n\nCan I have a different retry policy per each message type?\n\nNo. This is set at an endpoint level. You would have to have a specific queue per consumer to achieve this.\n\n\n\n"},"understand/default-topology.html":{"url":"understand/default-topology.html","title":"Topology","keywords":"","body":"Default Topology Conventions\nIn this example topology, two commands and events are used.\nFirst, the event contracts that are supported by an endpoint that receives files from a customer.\ninterface FileReceived\n{\n    Guid FileId { get; }\n    DateTime Timestamp { get; }\n    Uri Location { get; }\n}\n\ninterface CustomerDataReceived\n{\n    DateTime Timestamp { get; }\n    string CustomerId { get; }\n    string SourceAddress { get; }\n    Uri Location { get; }\n}\n\nSecond, the command contract for processing a file that was received.\ninterface ProcessFile\n{\n    Guid FileId { get; }\n    Uri Location { get; }\n}\n\nThe above contracts are used by the consumers to receive messages.

The main goal is to provide\na consistent, .NET friendly abstraction over the message transport (whether it is RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, etc.).\nTo meet this goal, MassTransit brings a lot of the application-specific logic closer to the developer in an easy to \nconfigure and understand manner.\nThe benefits of using MassTransit over the message transport, as opposed to using the raw transport APIs and building\neverything from scratch, are shown below. These are just a few, and some are more significant than others. The fact\nthat the hosting of your consumers, handlers, sagas, etc. are all managed consistently with a well documented\nproduction ready framework is the biggest advantage. You can also find numerous blog posts, podcasts, and articles\nwritten about MassTransit online.\nConcurrency\nConcurrent, asynchronous message consumers for maximum receive throughput and high server utilization.\nConnection management\nThe network is unreliable. If the application is disconnected from the message broker, MassTransit takes care of\nreconnecting and making sure all of the exchanges, queues, and bindings are restored.\nException, retries, and poison messages\nYour message consumers don't need to know about broker acknowledgement protocols. If your message consumer runs to \ncompletion, the message is acknowledged and removed from the queue. If you throw an exception, MassTransit uses a \nretry policy to redeliver the message to the consumer. If the retries are exhausted due to continued failures or\nother reasons, MassTransit moves the message to an error queue. If the message did not reach a consumer due to being\nmisrouted to the queue, the message is moved to a skipped queue.\nSerialization\nC# is a statically typed language, and developers work with types. RabbitMQ works with bytes. So how do you format\na message over the wire? How do you handle different date/time formats (local, UTC, unspecified)? How do you deal\nwith numbers, are they integers, longs, or decimals? MassTransit has already thought about this and implemented \nsensible defaults for you. And there are many serializers provided out of the box, including JSON, BSON, and XML as\nwell as the .NET binary formatter as a last resort.\nYou can even protect your messages using AES-256 encryption, to keep prying eyes away and to ensure the safety of\nprivate information (to meet PCI or HIPAA requirements).\nMessage header and correlation\nDesigning a common message envelope can be a nitty-gritty affair until things stabilize. And MassTransit is already\nstable having been used in production since 2008. The format is well documented\nand has been tested with billions of messages. Furthermore, the envelope includes headers for tracking messages,\nincluding conversations, correlations, and requests. The address and host information in the envelope make it easy to\nbuild any messaging pattern.\nConsumer lifecycle management\nMassTransit handles consumer creation and disposal, and integrates with most major dependency injection containers\nusing their built-in lifetime scope management. This ensures that dependencies are created and destroyed as part of \nthe message consumption pipeline.\nRouting\nMassTransit provides a heavily production tested convention for using RabbitMQ exchanges to route published messages\nto the subscribed consumers. The structure is CPU and memory friendly, which keeps RabbitMQ happy.\nRx integration\nInterested in or already using Reactive Extensions? MassTransit makes it easy to connect Rx to RabbitMQ.\nUnit testing made easy\nOne of the first rules of unit testing is to avoid hitting infrastructure. And RabbitMQ is just that. MassTransit \nincludes a high-performance in-memory transport for testing every consumer using the same code that would be used\nin production. And the MassTransit.TestFramework NuGet package includes test harnesses\nthat handle the setup and teardown of the bus so you can easily test your message consumers and sagas.\nSagas\nSagas are a powerful abstraction that supports message orchestration with durable state. Whether you use the original\nsomewhat explicit syntax, or the powerful state machine syntax of Automatonymous, you can build highly available\ndistributed workflow and coordination services easily. MassTransit supports both Entity Framework and NHibernate, using\ncode-based mapping and migrations to simply code deployments and upgrades.\nScheduling\nMassTransit has strong integration with Quartz.NET, to make it easy to schedule messages for future delivery. This brings\ndistributed applications into the fourth dimension, making time a first-class citizen. Some incredibly powerful routing\nsystems have been built by the authors using Quartz in combination with other MassTransit features.\nThere are also other scheduling providers that are supported by MassTransit, such as RabbitMQ deferred messages and\nAzure Service Bus scheduled enqueueing.\nMonitoring performance counters\nKeeping an eye on your services performance is critical, and having the right tools is a huge plus. MassTransit updates\na range of performance counters as messages are processed so operations can keep an eye on message flow and compare\nthe throughput to that of RabbitMQ.\n"},"understand/publishing.html":{"url":"understand/publishing.html","title":"Publishing messages","keywords":"","body":"Publishing messages\nWhen a message is published (by way of a call to bus.Publish), it's important to understand what MassTransit actually\ndoes under the hood. While the explicit implementation details depend upon the message transport being used, the general\npattern is the same.\nMassTransit follows the publish subscribe message pattern, where a copy of the message is delivered to each subscriber.\nThe message transport determines how the actual routing is performed, but the conventions of each transport are described below.\nRouting on RabbitMQ\nRabbitMQ provides powerful routing capabilities out of the box, in the form of exchanges and queues. Exchanges can be bound\nto queues, as well as other exchanges, making it easy to create a message routing fabric. MassTransit leverages exchanges\nand queues combined with the .NET type system to connect subscribers to publishers.\nMassTransit uses the message type to declare exchanges and exchange bindings that match the hierarchy of types implemented\nby the message type. Interfaces are declared as separate exchanges (using a fully-qualified type name that is compatible with\nthe naming structure of exchanges) and bound to the published message type exchange. When a message is first published, the\nexchanges are declared once, and then used for the life of the channel.\n\nPrivate types, such as classes, are declared as auto-delete so they do not clutter up the exchange namespace.\n\nOnce declared, published messages are to the message type exchange, and copies are routed to all the subscribers by RabbitMQ.\nThis approach was based on an article on how to maximize routing performance in RabbitMQ.\nThis dynamic, type-based routing model has proved very powerful in many large applications. The ability to add\nnew consumers to an existing message publisher is a great way to manage dependencies and keep projects from becoming tightly\ncoupled.\nTo see how this plays out, consider the following message types:\nnamespace Company.Messages\n{\n    public interface CustomerAddressUpdated\n    {\n    }\n\n    public interface UpdateCustomerAddress\n    {\n    }\n\n    public class UpdateCustomerAddressCommand :\n        UpdateCustomerAddress\n    {\n    }\n}\n\nOnce the messages have been published, exchanges are created in RabbitMQ for each of the message types:\nExchanges\n\nCompany.Messages.CustomerAddressUpdated\nCompany.Messages.UpdateCustomerAddress\nCompany.Messages.UpdateCustomerAddressCommand\n    - Includes a binding to Company.Messages.UpdateCustomerAddress\n\nWhen a receive endpoint is started, the second half of the exchange/queue binding is performed, where the consumer subscriptions\nare bound to the consumer message type exchanges, closing the loop.\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = cfg.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/\"), h =>\n    {\n        h.Username(\"guest\");\n        h.Password(\"guest\");\n    });\n\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"customer_update_queue\", e =>\n    {\n        e.Consumer();\n    });\n});\n\nThis results in the creation of a queue, as well as a binding to the queue from the UpdateCustomerAddress exchange.\nExchanges\n\ncustomer_update_queue\n    - Includes a binding from Company.Messages.UpdateCustomerAddress\n\nQueues\n\ncustomer_update_queue\n    - Includes a binding from the customer_update_queue exchange\n\n\nBecause RabbitMQ only allows messages to be sent to exchanges, an exchange matching the name of the queue is created and bound to the queue.\nThis makes it easy to send messages directly to the queue using the same name. It's actually a pretty cool abstraction, and RabbitMQ makes\nit very flexible by allowing exchange-to-exchange bindings. By keeping the bindings at the exchange level, it eliminates any impact to message\nflow. Dru shared his experience with this as well.\n\nBalancing the load\nBecause RabbitMQ is a message broker, it supports multiple readers from the same queue. This makes it super easy to setup a\nload balancing scenario where the same service is running on multiple servers, each of which is connected to the same queue. As\nmessages arrive on the queue, they are delivered to the first available consumer that can receive the message. To get good\nload balancing, it's important to set the PrefetchCount to a sensible value on the consumer so that messages are well distributed.\nRouting on Azure Service Bus\nMassTransit uses a similar approach for Azure Service Bus, but uses Topics, Subscriptions, and Queues.\n\nMore details to come...\n\n"},"understand/perfcounters.html":{"url":"understand/perfcounters.html","title":"Performance counters","keywords":"","body":"Performance counters\nMassTransit has support for updating Windows performance counters.

There are several application types, which are covered below. In these examples, the use of a dependency injection framework is not included. Using a container (such as Autofac, StructureMap, etc.) with MassTransit is covered separately.\nMassTransit in a console application\nA console application has a Main entry point, which is part of the Program.cs class by default. The example below configures a simple bus instance that publishes an event with a value entered.\nnamespace EventPublisher\n{\n    public interface ValueEntered\n    {\n        string Value { get; }\n    }\n\n    public class Program\n    {\n        public static void Main()\n        {\n            var busControl = ConfigureBus();\n\n            // Important! The bus must be started before using it!\n            busControl.Start();\n            do\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Enter message (or quit to exit)\");\n                Console.Write(\"> \");\n                string value = Console.ReadLine();\n\n                if(\"quit\".Equals(value, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))\n                    break;\n\n                busControl.Publish(new\n                {\n                    Value = value\n                });\n            }\n            while (true);\n\n            busControl.Stop();\n        }\n\n        static IBusControl ConfigureBus()\n        {\n            return Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n            {\n                cfg.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost\"), h =>\n                {\n                    h.Username(\"guest\");\n                    h.Password(\"guest\");\n                });\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn the example, the bus is configured and started, after which a publishing loop allows values to be entered and published. When the loop exits, the busControl variable is disposed, which stops the bus.\nAlways start the bus before starting to use it. Of course, you can only start a configured bus.\nMassTransit and ASP.NET Core\nMassTransit integrates natively with ASP.NET Core using the MassTransit.AspNetCore package.\nThe package includes the following features:\n\nHosted service to start and stop the bus following the application lifecycle\nRegisters the bus instance as a singleton for the required interfaces\nAdds health checks for the bus instance and receive endpoints\nTells the bus to use the ASP.NET Core logger\n\nIf you want to register your consumers in the ASP.NET Core service collection, use the following code as an example:\npublic class Startup\n{\n    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n    {\n        // Add framework services\n        services.AddHealthChecks();\n\n        services.AddMvc();\n\n        // Register your consumers if the need dependencies\n        services.AddScoped()\n\n        // Register MassTransit\n        services.AddMassTransit(x =>\n        {\n            x.AddConsumer();\n\n            x.AddBus(provider => Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n            {\n                var host = cfg.Host(new Uri(\"localhost\"), hostConfigurator => \n                { \n                    hostConfigurator.Username(\"guest\");\n                    hostConfigurator.Password(\"guest\");\n                });\n\n                cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"submit-order\", ep =>\n                {\n                    ep.PrefetchCount = 16;\n                    ep.UseMessageRetry(r => r.Interval(2, 100));\n\n                    ep.ConfigureConsumer(provider);\n                });\n            }));\n        });\n    }\n\n    // everything else\n}\n\nRemember, however, that it is perfectly fine to set up all the required dependencies in the Startup, which serves as the bootstrap code for your application. By doing that you can avoid weird cases when you have two dependencies that implement the same interface and then you cannot properly register them both, since only the last one will count.\nHere is how you can avoid using the container:\npublic class Startup\n{\n    private IConfiguration Configuration { get; }\n    private ILoggerFactory LoggerFactory { get; }\n\n    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)\n    {\n        Configuration = configuration;\n        LoggerFactory = loggerFactory;\n    }\n\n    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n    {\n        // Add framework services\n        services.AddHealthChecks();\n\n        services.AddMvc();\n\n        // Using factory delegates for transient dependencies\n        var someDependencyFactory = \n            () => new SomeDependency(Configuration[\"connectionStrings:mySqlDatabase\"]);\n\n        // Using instances for singletons\n        var anotherDependency = \n            new SomeDocumentStore(Configuration[\"connectionString:documentStore\"]);\n\n        // Register MassTransit. Here we need to send the logger factory.\n        services.AddMassTransit(ConfigureBus(), LoggerFactory);\n    }\n\n    private IBusControl ConfigureBus() =>\n        Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n        {\n            var host = cfg.Host(\"localhost\", host => \n            { \n                host.Username(\"guest\");\n                host.Password(\"guest\");\n            });\n\n            cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"submit-order\", ep =>\n            {\n                ep.PrefetchCount = 16;\n                ep.UseMessageRetry(x => x.Interval(2, 100));\n\n                ep.Consumer(() => \n                    new OrderConsumer(someDependency(), anotherDependency));\n            });\n        });\n\n    // everything else\n}\n\nTo make the health checks work, remember to add this line to the Configure method in the Startup.cs file:\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)\n{\n    app.UseHealthChecks(\"/health\", new HealthCheckOptions {Predicate = check => check.Tags.Contains(\"ready\")});\n\n    // everything else\n}\n\nAlso, as an obvious requirement, you need to use .NET Core 2.2 (or higher) and have those two package references in your project file:\n\n\n\nOf course, health checks only work when you provide an endpoint that is accessible via http or https. That implies that you cannot do that using the Microsoft.NET.Sdk, so you need to ensure that your csproj file starts with this line:\n\n\nThe Web SDK is used by default if you are using the ASP.NET Core Web Application template, but you can also change it, if you used the Console Application template. In such a case you'd also need to add some more packages to be able to host the http endpoint using Kestrel. The easiest way to migrate a console application to the web application (that still runs as a console application) by creating a new web application with the type Empty and checking the differences.\nMassTransit in a Windows service\nA Windows service is recommended for consuming commands and events as it provides an autonomous execution environment for message consumers. The service can be started and stopped using the service control manager, as well as monitored by operations tools.\n\nNote:\n    To create a Windows service, we strongly recommend using Topshelf, as it was built specifically for this purpose. Topshelf is easy to use, has zero dependencies, and creates a service that can be self-installed without additional tools.\n\n\nThe important aspect of configuring a bus in a Windows service is to ensure that the bus is only configured and started when the service is started.\nnamespace EventService\n{\n    using Topshelf;\n\n    public class Program\n    {\n        public static int Main()\n        {\n            return (int)HostFactory.Run(cfg => cfg.Service(x => new EventConsumerService());\n        }\n    }\n\n    class EventConsumerService :\n        ServiceControl\n    {\n        IBusControl _bus;\n\n        public bool Start(HostControl hostControl)\n        {\n            _bus = ConfigureBus();\n            _bus.Start();\n\n            return true;\n        }\n\n        public bool Stop(HostControl hostControl)\n        {\n            _bus?.Stop(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));\n\n            return true;\n        }\n\n        IBusControl ConfigureBus()\n        {\n            return Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n            {\n                var host = cfg.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost\"), h =>\n                {\n                    h.Username(\"guest\");\n                    h.Password(\"guest\");\n                });\n\n                cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"event_queue\", e =>\n                {\n                    e.Handler(context =>\n                        Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($\"Value was entered: {context.Message.Value}\"));\n                })\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nMassTransit in a web application\nConfiguring a bus in a web site is typically done to publish events, send commands, as well as engage in request/response conversations. Hosting receive endpoints and persistent consumers is not recommended (use a service as shown above).\nASP.NET (MVC/WebApi2)\nIn a web application, the HttpApplication class methods of Application_Start and Application_End are used to configure/start the bus and stop the bus respectively.\n\nNote:\n    While many MassTransit samples use Topshelf, web applications are an exception where the standard web application conventions are followed.\n\n\npublic class MvcApplication : HttpApplication\n{\n    static IBusControl _busControl;\n\n    public static IBus Bus\n    {\n        get { return _busControl; }\n    }\n\n    protected void Application_Start()\n    {\n        _busControl = ConfigureBus();\n        _busControl.Start();\n    }\n\n    protected void Application_End()\n    {\n        _busControl.Stop(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));;\n    }\n\n    IBusControl ConfigureBus()\n    {\n        return Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n        {\n            var host = cfg.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost\"), h =>\n            {\n                h.Username(\"guest\");\n                h.Password(\"guest\");\n            });\n        });\n    }\n}\n\npublic class NotifyController : Controller\n{\n    public async Task Put(string value)\n    {\n        await MvcApplication.Bus.Publish(new\n        {\n            Value = value\n        });\n\n        return View();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class CommandController : Controller\n{\n    public async Task Send(string value)\n    {\n        var endpoint = await MvcApplication.Bus.GetSendEndpoint(_serviceAddress);\n\n        await endpoint.Send(new\n        {\n            Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow,\n            Value = value\n        });\n\n        return View();\n    }\n}\n\nThe above example is kept simple, providing a static MvcApplication.Bus property to access the bus instance (for publishing events, and sending commands to endpoints). Newer version of ASP.NET have built-in dependency resolution, in which case the IBus should be registered so that controllers can specify the dependency in the constructor. In fact, the inherited IPublishEndpoint and ISendEndpointProvider should also be registered.\nThe example controllers show how to publish and send messages as well.\nOWIN Pipeline (WebApi2)\nWebApi2 can alternatively use the OWIN pipeline. But OWIN doesn't have Application_End and so it requires a different approach to ensure the bus is disposed properly.\nThis example shows an OWIN WebApi2 project using the Autofac Container. The concept should be similar if you aren't using WebApi2 or a different Container, but still OWIN.\npublic class Startup\n{\n    public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)\n    {\n        // STANDARD WEB API SETUP:\n\n        // Get your HttpConfiguration. In OWIN, you'll create one\n        // rather than using GlobalConfiguration.\n        var config = new HttpConfiguration();\n\n        WebApiConfig.Register(config); // Register your routes\n\n        // Make the autofac container\n        var builder = new ContainerBuilder();\n\n        // Register your Bus\n        builder.Register(c =>\n            {\n                return Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(sbc =>\n                    sbc.Host(\"localhost\",\"dev\", h =>\n                    {\n                        h.Username(\"guest\");\n                        h.Password(\"guest\");\n                    })\n                );\n            })\n            .As()\n            .As()\n            .SingleInstance();\n\n        // Register anything else you might need...\n\n        // Build the container\n        var container = builder.Build();\n\n        // OWIN WEB API SETUP:\n\n        // set the DependencyResolver\n        config.DependencyResolver = new AutofacWebApiDependencyResolver(container);\n\n        // Register the Autofac middleware FIRST, then the Autofac Web API middleware,\n        // and finally the standard Web API middleware.\n\n        app.UseAutofacMiddleware(container);\n        app.UseAutofacWebApi(config);\n        app.UseWebApi(config);\n\n        // Starts Mass Transit Service bus, and registers stopping of bus on app dispose\n        var bus = container.Resolve();\n        var busHandle = TaskUtil.Await(() => bus.StartAsync());\n\n        var properties = new AppProperties(app.Properties);\n\n        if(properties.OnAppDisposing != CancellationToken.None)\n        {\n            properties.OnAppDisposing.Register(() => busHandle.Stop(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)));\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe important bit is the last several lines where we resolve the IBusControl and register an action to stop when the app disposes.\nYou'll also notice we registered the bus .As(). That's because we are following the guidance above, where our websites should really only be Publishing to the service bus.\nNow your controller might look like:\npublic class MyController : ApiController\n{\n    private readonly IPublishEndpoint _publishEndpoint;\n\n    public MyController(IPublishEndpoint publishEndpoint)\n    {\n        _publishEndpoint = publishEndpoint;\n    }\n\n    [HttpPost]\n    public async Task OrderShipped(int orderId)\n    {\n        await _publishEndpoint.Publish(\n        new\n        {\n            OrderId = orderId\n        });\n\n        return Ok(\"Success!\");\n    }\n}\n\n"},"usage/transports.html":{"url":"usage/transports.html","title":"Choose a transport","keywords":"","body":"Transports\nThis pages shortly describes the included transports.

It's also very fast. But it isn't durable, and messages are gone if the bus is stopped or the process terminates. So, it's generally not a smart option for a production system. However, there are places where durability it not important so the cautionary tale is to proceed with caution.\n\n\nThe In-Memory transport uses the loopback address (a holdover from previous version of MassTransit).

Messages can be defined using both classes and interfaces, however, it is suggested that types use read-only properties and no behavior.\n\nNote:\nIt is strongly suggested to use interfaces for message contracts, based on experience over several years with varying levels of developer experience. MassTransit will create dynamic interface implementations for the messages, ensuring a clean separation of the message contract from the consumer.\n\n\nAn example message to update a customer address is shown below.\n    namespace Company.Application.Contracts\n    {\n        using System;\n\n        public interface UpdateCustomerAddress\n        {\n            Guid CommandId { get; }\n            DateTime Timestamp { get; }\n            string CustomerId { get; }\n            string HouseNumber { get; }\n            string Street { get; }\n            string City { get; }\n            string State { get; }\n            string PostalCode { get; }\n        }\n    }\n\nA common mistake when engineers are new to messaging is to create a base class for messages, and try to dispatch that base class in the consumer – including the behavior of the subclass. Ouch. This always leads to pain and suffering, so just say no to base classes.\nSpecifying message names\nThere are two main message types, events and commands. When choosing a name for a message, the type of message should dictate the tense of the message.\nCommands\nA command tells a service to do something. Commands are sent (using Send) to an endpoint, as it is expected that a single service instance performs the command action. A command should never be published.\nCommands should be expressed in a verb-noun sequence, following the tell style.\nExample Commands:\n\nUpdateCustomerAddress\nUpgradeCustomerAccount\nSubmitOrder\n\nEvents\nAn event signifies that something has happened. Events are published (using Publish) using either IBus or the ConsumeContext within a message consumer. An event should never be sent directly to an endpoint.\nEvents should be expressed in a noun-verb (past tense) sequence, indicating that something happened.\nExample Events:\n\nCustomerAddressUpdated\nCustomerAccountUpgraded\nOrderSubmitted, OrderAccepted, OrderRejected, OrderShipped\n\nMessage correlation\nSince messages usually do not live in isolation, publishing one message usually leads to publishing another message, and then another, and so on. It is useful to trace such sequences, however, to find them these messages need to have some information detailing how they relate to each other.\nCorrelation is the principle of connecting messages together, usually by using a unique identifier that is included in every message that is part of a logical sequence. In MassTransit, the unique identifier is referred to as the CorrelationId, which is included in the message envelope and available via the ConsumeContext or the SendContext. MassTransit also includes a ConversationId which is the same across an entire set of related messages.\nMassTransit supports different methods to specify the correlationId. Check the Correlating messages article for more information.\nGuidelines\nGiven everything that was stated above, here are a few guidelines.\n\nInterface-based inheritance is OK, don't be afraid, but don't go nuts.\nClass-based inheritance is to be approached with caution.\nComposing messages together ends up pushing us into content-based routing which is something we don't recommend.\nMessage Design is not OO Design (A message is just state, no behavior). There is a greater focus on interop and contract design.\nAs messages are more about contracts, we suggest subscribing to interfaces that way you can easily evolve the message definition.\nA big base class may cause pain down the road as each change will have a larger ripple. This can be especially bad when you need to support multiple versions.\n\n"},"usage/message-consumers.html":{"url":"usage/message-consumers.html","title":"Create message consumers","keywords":"","body":"Creating a message consumer\n\n\nConnecting a message consumer\nConnecting to an existing bus\n\n\nConnecting an existing consumer instance\nHandling undeliverable messages\n\n\nHandling messages without a consumer\nObserving messages via IObserver\n\n\nA message consumer is a class that consumes one or more message types, specified by the IConsumer interface, where T is the message type.\npublic class UpdateCustomerConsumer :\n    IConsumer\n{\n    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($\"Updating customer: {context.Message.CustomerId}\");\n\n        // update the customer address\n    }\n}\n\nWhen a consumer is subscribed to a receive endpoint, and a message consumed by the consumer is received by the endpoint, an instance of the consumer is created (using a consumer factory, which is covered --> here ConsumeContext) is then delivered to the consumer via the Consume method.\nThe Consume method is asynchronous, and returns a Task. The task is awaited by MassTransit, during which time the message is unavailable to other receive endpoints. If the consume method completes successfully (a task status of RanToCompletion), the message is acknowledged and removed from the queue.\n\nNote:\n    If the consumer faults (such as throwing an exception, resulting in a task status of Faulted), or is somehow cancelled (TaskStatus of Canceled), the exception is propagated back up the pipeline where it can ultimately be retried or moved to an error queue.\n\n\nConnecting a message consumer\nFor a consumer to receive messages, the consumer must be connected to a receive endpoint. This is done during bus configuration, particularly within the configuration of a receive endpoint.\nAn example of connecting a consumer to a receive endpoint is shown below.\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = cfg.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/\"));\n\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"customer_update_queue\", e =>\n    {\n        e.Consumer();\n    });\n});\n\nThe example creates a bus, which connects to the RabbitMQ running on the local machine, using the default username and password (guest/guest). On that bus. a single receive endpoint is created with the name customer_update_queue. The consumer is connected using the simplest method, which accepts a consumer class with a default constructor.\n\nNote:\n    When a consumer is connected to a receive endpoint, the combined set of message types consumed by all of the consumers connected to the same receive endpoint are *subscribed* to the queue. The subscription method varies by broker, in the case of RabbitMQ exchange bindings are created for the message types to the exchange/queue for the receive endpoint.\n\n    These subscriptions are persistent, and remain in place after the process exits. This ensures that messages published or sent that would be delivered to one of the receive endpoint consumers are saved even is the process is terminated. When the process is started, messages waiting in the queue will be delivered to the consumer(s).\n\n\nThe above example connects the consumer using a default constructor consumer factory. There are several other consumer factories supported, as shown below.\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = ...;\n\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"customer_update_queue\", e =>\n    {\n        // an anonymous factory method\n        e.Consumer(() => new YourConsumer());\n\n        // an existing consumer factory for the consumer type\n        e.Consumer(consumerFactory);\n\n        // a type-based factory that returns an object (container friendly)\n        e.Consumer(consumerType, type => container.Resolve(type));\n\n        // an anonymous factory method, with some middleware goodness\n        e.Consumer(() => new YourConsumer(), x =>\n        {\n            // add middleware to the consumer pipeline\n            x.UseLog(ConsoleOut, async context => \"Consumer created\");\n        });\n    });\n});\n\nConnecting to an existing bus\nOnce a bus has been created, the receive endpoints have been created and cannot be modified. The bus itself, however, provides a temporary (auto-delete) queue which can be used to receive messages. To connect a consumer to the bus temporary queue, a series of Connect methods can be used.\n\nWarning:\n    Published messages will not be received by the temporary queue. Because the queue is temporary, when consumers are connected no bindings or subscriptions are created. This makes it very fast for transient consumers, and avoid thrashing the message broker with temporary bindings.\n\n\nThe temporary queue is useful to receive request responses and faults (via the response/fault address header) and routing slip events (via an event subscription in the routing slip).\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = ...;\n});\n\nbusControl.Start();\n\nConnectHandle handle = busControl.ConnectConsumer();\n...\nhandle.Disconnect(); // disconnect the consumer from the bus pipeline\n\nIn addition to the ConnectConsumer method, methods for each consumer type are also included (ConnectHandler, ConnectInstance, ConnectSaga, and ConnectStateMachineSaga).\nConnecting an existing consumer instance\nWhile using a consumer instance per message is highly suggested, it is possible to connect an existing consumer instance which will be called for every message. The consumer must be thread-safe, as the Consume method will be called from multiple threads simultaneously. To connect an existing instance, see the example below.\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = ...;\n\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"customer_update_queue\", e =>\n    {\n        e.Instance(existingConsumer);\n    });\n});\n\nHandling undeliverable messages\nIf the configuration of an endpoint changes, or if a message is mistakenly sent to an endpoint, it is possible that a message type is received that does not have any connected consumers. If this occurs, the message is moved to a _skipped queue (prefixed by the original queue name). The original message content is retained, and additional headers are added to indicate the host which moved the message.\nHandling messages without a consumer\nWhile creating a consumer is the preferred way to consume messages, it is also possible to create a simple message handler. By specifying a method, anonymous method, or lambda method, a message can be consumed on a receive endpoint.\nTo configure a simple message handler, refer to the example below.\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = ...;\n\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"customer_update_queue\", e =>\n    {\n        e.Handler(context =>\n            return Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($\"Update customer address received: {context.Message.CustomerId}\"));\n    });\n});\n\nIn this case, the method is called for each message received. No consumer is created, and no lifecycle management is performed.\nObserving messages via IObserver\nWith the addition of the IObserver interface, the concept of an observer was added to the .NET framework. MassTransit supports the direct connection of observers to receive endpoints.\n\nUnfortunately, observers are not asynchronous. Because of this, it is not possible to play nice with the async support provided by the compiler when using an observer.\n\nAn observer is defined using the built-in IObserver interface, as shown below.\npublic class CustomerAddressUpdatedObserver :\n    IObserver>\n{\n    public void OnNext(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Customer address was updated: {0}\", context.Message.CustomerId);\n    }\n\n    public void OnError(Exception error)\n    {\n    }\n\n    public void OnCompleted()\n    {\n    }\n}\n\nOnce created, the observer is connected to the receive endpoint similar to a consumer.\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = ...;\n\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"customer_update_queue\", e =>\n    {\n        e.Observer();\n    });\n});\n\n"},"usage/producing-messages.html":{"url":"usage/producing-messages.html","title":"Produce messages","keywords":"","body":"Producing messages\n\n\nSending commands\nUsing endpoint conventions\nSending via interfaces\nSetting message headers\n\n\nPublishing events\n\n\nAn application or service can produce messages using two different methods. A message can be sent using Send or a message can be published using Publish. The behavior of each method is very different, but it easy to understand by looking at the type of messages involved with each particular method.\nWhen a message is sent, it is delivered to a specific endpoint using a DestinationAddress. When a message is published, it is not sent to a specific endpoint, but is instead broadcasted to any consumers which have subscribed to the message type. For these two separate behavior, we describe messages sent as commands, and messages published as events.\n\nThese are discussed in depth in the Creating a message contract section of the documentation.\n\nSending commands\nSending a command to an endpoint requires an ISendEndpoint reference, which can be obtained from any send endpoint provider (an object that supports ISendEndpointProvider). The application should always use the object closest to it to obtain the send endpoint, and it should do it every time it needs it -- the application should not cache the send endpoint reference.\nFor instance, an IBus instance is a send endpoint provider, but it should never be used by a consumer to obtain an ISendEndpoint. ConsumeContext can also provide send endpoints, and should be used since it is closer to the consumer.\n\nNote:\n    This cannot be stressed enough -- always get send endpoints from the closest interface to the application code. There is extensive logic to tie message flows together using conversation, correlation, and initiator identifiers. By skipping a level and going outside the closest scope, that information can be lost which prevents the useful trace identifiers from being properly handled.\n\n\nTo obtain a send endpoint from a send endpoint provider, use the GetSendEndpoint() method as shown below. Once the send endpoint is returned, it can be used to a send a message.\npublic async Task SendOrder(ISendEndpointProvider sendEndpointProvider)\n{\n    var endpoint = await sendEndpointProvider.GetSendEndpoint(_serviceAddress);\n\n    await endpoint.Send(new SubmitOrder(...));\n}\n\nThere are many overloads for the Send method. Because MassTransit is built around filters and pipes, pipes are used to customize the message delivery behavior of Send. There are also some useful overloads (via extension methods) to make sending easier and less noisy due to the pipe construction, etc.\nUsing endpoint conventions\nUsing send endpoints might seem too verbose, because before sending any message, you need to get the send endpoint and to do that you need to have an endpoint address. Usually, addresses are kept in the configuration and accessing the configuration from all over the application is not a good practice.\nEndpoint conventions solve this issue by allowing you to configure the mapping between message types and endpoint addresses. A potential downside here that you will not be able to send messages of the same type to different endpoints by using conventions. If you need to do this, keep using the GetSendEndpoint method.\nConventions are configured like this:\nEndpointConvention.Map(\n    new Uri(\"rabbitmq://mq.acme.com/order/order_processing\"));\n\nNow, you don't need to get the send endpoint anymore for this type of message and can send it like this:\npublic async Task Post(SubmitOrderRequest request)\n{\n    if (AllGoodWith(request))\n        await _bus.Send(ConvertToCommand(request));\n}\n\nAlso, from inside the consumer, you can do the same using the ConsumeContext.Send overload:\nEndpointConvention.Map(\n    new Uri(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"deliveryServiceQueue\"]));\n\npublic class SubmitOrderConsumer : IConsumer\n{\n    private readonly IOrderSubmitter _orderSubmitter;\n\n    public SubmitOrderConsumer(IOrderSubmitter submitter)\n        => _orderSubmitter = submitter;\n\n    public async Task Consume(IConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        await _orderSubmitter.Process(context.Message);\n\n        await context.Send(\n            new StartDelivery(context.Message.OrderId, DateTime.UtcNow));\n    }\n}\n\nThe EndpointConvention.Map method is static, so it can be called from everywhere. It is important to remember that you cannot configure conventions for the same message twice. If you try to do this - the Map method will throw an exception. This is also important when writing tests, so you need to configure the conventions at the same time as you confgigure your test bus (harness).\nIt is better to configure send conventions before you start the bus.\nSending via interfaces\nSince the general recommendation is to use interfaces, there are convenience methods to initialize the interface without requiring the creation of a message class underneath. While versioning of messages still requires a class which supports multiple interfaces, a simple approach to send an interface message is shown below.\npublic interface SubmitOrder\n{\n    string OrderId { get; }\n    DateTime OrderDate { get; }\n    decimal OrderAmount { get; }\n}\n\npublic async Task SendOrder(ISendEndpoint endpoint)\n{\n    await endpoint.Send(new\n    {\n        OrderId = \"27\",\n        OrderDate = DateTime.UtcNow,\n        OrderAmount = 123.45m\n    });\n}\n\nSetting message headers\nThere are a variety of message headers available which are used for correlation and tracking of messages. It is also possible to override some of the default behaviors of MassTransit when a fault occurs. For instance, a fault is normally published when a consumer throws an exception. If instead the application wants faults delivered to a specific address, the FaultAddress can be specified via a header. How this is done is shown below.\npublic interface SubmitOrder\n{\n    string OrderId { get; }\n    DateTime OrderDate { get; }\n    decimal OrderAmount { get; }\n}\n\npublic async Task SendOrder(ISendEndpoint endpoint)\n{\n    await endpoint.Send(new\n    {\n        OrderId = \"27\",\n        OrderDate = DateTime.UtcNow,\n        OrderAmount = 123.45m\n    }, context => \n        context.FaultAddress = new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/order_faults\"));\n}\n\nPublishing events\nMessages are published similarly to how messages are sent, but in this case, a single IPublishEndpoint is used. The same rules for endpoints apply, the closest instance of the publish endpoint should be used. So the ConsumeContext for consumers, and IBus for applications that are published outside of a consumer context.\nTo publish a message, see the code below:\npublic interface OrderSubmitted\n{\n    string OrderId { get; }\n    DateTime OrderDate { get; }\n}\n\npublic async Task NotifyOrderSubmitted(IPublishEndpoint publishEndpoint)\n{\n    await publishEndpoint.Publish(new\n    {\n        OrderId = \"27\",\n        OrderDate = DateTime.UtcNow,\n    });\n}\n\nIf you are planning to publish messages from within your consumers, this example would suit better:\npublic class SubmitOrderConsumer : IConsumer\n{\n    private readonly IOrderSubmitter _orderSubmitter;\n\n    public SubmitOrderConsumer(IOrderSubmitter submitter)\n        => _orderSubmitter = submitter;\n\n    public async Task Consume(IConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        await _orderSubmitter.Process(context.Message);\n\n        await context.Publish(new\n        {\n            OrderId = context.Message.OrderId,\n            OrderDate = DateTime.UtcNow\n        })\n    }\n}\n\n"},"usage/message-initializers.html":{"url":"usage/message-initializers.html","title":"Initialize messages","keywords":"","body":"Initializing interface message contracts\nMassTransit continues to encourage and support the use of interfaces for message contracts, and initializers make it easy to produce interface messages.\nAn object of values\nSend, Publish, and most of the methods that behave in similar ways (scheduling, responding to requests, etc.) all support passing an object of values which is used to set the properties on the specified interface. A simple example is shown below.\nConsider this example message contract to submit an order.\npublic interface SubmitOrder\n{\n    Guid OrderId { get; }\n    DateTime OrderDate { get; }\n    string OrderNumber { get; }\n    decimal OrderAmount { get; }\n}\n\nTo send this message to an endpoint:\nawait endpoint.Send(new\n{\n    OrderId = NewId.NextGuid(),\n    OrderDate = DateTime.UtcNow,\n    OrderNumber = \"18001\",\n    OrderAmount = 123.45m\n});\n\nThe anonymous object is loosely typed, the properties are matched by name, and there is an extensive set of type conversions that may occur to obtain match the types defined by the interface. Most numeric, string, and date/time conversations are supported, as well as several advanced conversions (including variables, and asynchronous Task results).\nCollections, including arrays, lists, and dictionaries, are broadly supported, including the conversion of list elements, as well as dictionary keys and values. For instance, a dictionary of (int,decimal) could be converted on the fly to (long, string) using the default format conversions.\nNested objects are also supported, for instance, if a property was of type Address and another anonymous object was created (or any type whose property names match the names of the properties on the message contract), those properties would be set on the message contract.\nHeaders\nHeader values can be specified in the anonymous object using a double-underscore (pronounced 'dunder' apparently) property name. For instance, to set the message time-to-live, specify a property with the duration. Remember, any value that can be converted to a TimeSpan works!\npublic interface GetOrderStatus\n{\n    Guid OrderId { get; }\n}\n\nvar response = await requestClient.GetResponse(new \n{\n    __TimeToLive = 15000, // 15 seconds, or in this case, 15000 milliseconds\n    OrderId = orderId,\n});\n\n\nactually, that's a bad example since the request client already sets the message expiration, but you, get, the, point.\n\nTo add a custom header value, a special property name format is used. In the name, underscores are converted to dashes, and double underscores are converted to underscores. In the following example:\nvar response = await requestClient.GetResponse(new \n{\n    __Header_X_B3_TraceId = zipkinTraceId,\n    __Header_X_B3_SpanId = zipkinSpanId,\n    OrderId = orderId,\n});\n\nThis would include set the headers used by open tracing (or Zipkin, as shown above) as part of the request message so the service could share in the span/trace. In this case, X-B3-TraceId and X-B3-SpanId would be added to the message envelope, and depending upon the transport, copied to the transport headers as well.\nVariables\nMassTransit also supports variables, which are special types added to the anonymous object. Following the example above, the initialization could be changed to use variables for the OrderId and OrderDate. Variables are consistent throughout the message creation, using the same variable multiple times returns the value. For instance, the Id created to set the OrderId would be the same used to set the OrderId in each item.\npublic interface OrderItem\n{\n    Guid OrderId { get; }\n    string ItemNumber { get; }\n}\n\npublic interface SubmitOrder\n{\n    Guid OrderId { get; }\n    DateTime OrderDate { get; }\n    string OrderNumber { get; }\n    decimal OrderAmount { get; }\n    OrderItem[] OrderItems { get; }\n}\n\nawait endpoint.Send(new\n{\n    OrderId = InVar.Id,\n    OrderDate = InVar.Timestamp,\n    OrderNumber = \"18001\",\n    OrderAmount = 123.45m,\n    OrderItems = new[]\n    {\n        new { OrderId = InVar.Id, ItemNumber = \"237\" },\n        new { OrderId = InVar.Id, ItemNumber = \"762\" }\n    }\n});\n\nAwaiting Task results\nMessage initializers are now asynchronous, which makes it possible to do some pretty cool things, including waiting for Task input properties to complete and use the result to initialize the property. An example is shown below.\npublic interface OrderUpdated\n{\n    Guid CorrelationId { get; }\n    DateTime Timestamp { get; }\n    Guid OrderId { get; }\n    Customer Customer { get; }\n}\n\npublic async Task LoadCustomer(Guid orderId)\n{\n    // work happens up in here\n}\n\nawait context.Publish(new\n{\n    InVar.CorrelationId,\n    InVar.Timestamp,\n    OrderId = context.Message.OrderId,\n    Customer = LoadCustomer(context.Message.OrderId)\n});\n\nThe property initializer will wait for the task result and then use it to initialize the property (converting all the types, etc. as it would any other object).\n\nWhile it is of course possible to await the call to LoadCustomer, properties are initialized in parallel, and thus, allowing the initializer to await the Task can result in better overall performance. Your mileage may vary, however.\n\n"},"usage/correlation.html":{"url":"usage/correlation.html","title":"Correlate messages","keywords":"","body":"Correlating messages\nIn a distributed message-based system, message correlation is very important. Since operations are potentially executing across hundreds of nodes, the ability to correlate different messages to build a path through the system is absolutely necessary for engineers to troubleshoot problems.\nThe headers on the message envelope provided by MassTransit already make it easy to specify correlation values. In fact, most are setup by default if not specified by the developer.\nMassTransit provides the interface CorrelatedBy, which can be used to setup a default correlationId. This is used by sagas as well, since all sagas have a unique CorrelationId for each instance of the saga. If a message implements CorrelatedBy, it will automatically be directed to the saga instance with the matching identifier. If a new saga instance is created by the event, it will be assigned the CorrelationId from the initiating message.\nFor message types that have a correlation identifier, but are not using the CorrelatedBy interface, it is possible to declare the identifier for the message type and MassTransit will use that identifier by default for correlation.\nMessageCorrelation.UseCorrelationId(x => x.SomeGuidValue);\n\n\nNote:\n    This should be called before you start the bus. We currently recommend that you put all of these in a static method for easy grouping and then call it at the beginning of the MassTransit configuration block.\n\n\nMost transactions in a system will end up being logged and wide scale correlation is likely. Therefore, the use of consistent correlation identifiers is recommended. In fact, using a Guid type is highly recommended. MassTransit uses the NewId library to generate identifiers that are unique and sequential that are represented as a Guid. The identifiers are clustered-index friendly, being ordered in a way that SQL Server can efficiently insert them into a database with the uniqueidentifier as the primary key. Just use NewId.NextGuid() to generate an identifier -- it's fast, fun, and all your friends are doing it.\n\nNote:\n    So, what does correlated actually mean? In short it means that this message is a part of a larger conversation. For instance, you may have a message that says New Order (Item:Hammers; Qty:22; OrderNumber:45) and there may be another message that is a response to that message that says Order Allocated(OrderNumber:45). In this case, the order number is acting as your correlation identifier, it ties the messages together.\n\n\nCorrelation by convention\nIn addition to the explicit CorrelateBy interface, a convention-based correlation is supported. If the message contract has a property named CorrelationId, CommandId, or EventId, the correlationId header is automatically populated on Send or Publish. It can also be manually specified using the SendContext.\nBear in mind that sagas default CorrelateById() only support messages where the explicit CorrelateBy interface is implemented. However, the header is still useful if you do not use sagas, for example for message flow analysis and debugging.\nTracing conversations\nThere are several other built-in message headers that can be used to correlate messages. However, it is also completely acceptable to add your own custom properties to the message contract for correlation.\nIn addition to the correlationId, the default headers include:\nRequestId\n  When using the RequestClient, or the request/response message handling of MassTransit, each request is assigned a unique RequestId. When the message is received by a consumer, the response message sent by the Respond method (on the ConsumeContext) is assigned the same RequestId so that it can be correlated by the request client. This header should not typically be set by the consumer, as it is handled automatically.\nConversationId\n  The conversation is created by the first message that is sent or published, in which no existing context is available (such as when a message is sent or published by using IBus.Send or IBus.Publish). If an existing context is used to send or publish a message, the ConversationId is copied to the new message, ensuring that a set of messages within the same conversation have the same identifier.\nInitiatorId\n  When a message is created within the context of an existing message, such as in a consumer, a saga, etc., the CorrelationId of the message (if available, otherwise the MessageId may be used) is copied to the InitiatorId header. This makes it possible to combine a chain of messages into a graph of producers and consumers.\nMessageId\n  When a message is sent or published, this header is automatically generated for the message.\n"},"usage/containers/":{"url":"usage/containers/","title":"Use IoC container","keywords":"","body":"Configuring a container\nMassTransit does not require a dependency injection container, however, it includes support for the most popular containers. Each container has its own style, and as such usage scenarios may vary.\nMassTransit now has a consistent API for registration and configuration when using a container, as well as conventions for configuring receive endpoints based upon the registered consumers, routing slip activities, and sagas. Under the hood, each container is configured to properly interact with MassTransit, leveraging available container features, such as nested scopes for message consumers, without requiring the developer to explictly configure every consumer.\n\nNote:\n    Dependency Injection styles are a personal choice that each developer or organization must make on their own. We recognize this choice, and respect it, and will not judge those who don't use a particular container or style of dependency injection.

NHibernate saga repository is then registered as generic and since it only uses the ISession, everything will just work.\nvar mappings = mappingsAssembly\n    .GetTypes()\n    .Where(t => t.BaseType != null && t.BaseType.IsGenericType &&\n        (t.BaseType.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(SagaClassMapping<>) ||\n        t.BaseType.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(ClassMapping<>)))\n    .ToArray();\nbuilder.Register(c => new SqlServerSessionFactoryProvider(connString, mappings).GetSessionFactory())\n    .As()\n    .SingleInstance();\nbuilder.RegisterGeneric(typeof(NHibernateSagaRepository<>))\n    .As(typeof(ISagaRepository<>));\n\nEntity Framework\nEntity Framework saga repository needs to have a context factory as a constructor parameter. This factory just returns a DbContext instance, which should have the information about the saga instance class mapping.\nWhen using the SagaDbContext, you need to register each repository separately like this:\nbuilder.Register(c => new EntityFrameworkSagaRepository(\n    () => new SagaDbContext(connectionString)))\n        .As>().SingleInstance();\n\nYou can use your own context implementation and register the repository as generic like this:\nbuilder.Register(c => new AssemblyScanningSagaDbContext(typeof(MySagaMapping).Assembly,\n    connectionString).As();\nbuilder.RegisterGeneric(typeof(EntityFrameworkSagaRepository<>))\n    .As(typeof(ISagaRepository<>))\n    .SingleInstance();\nbuilder.RegisterStateMachineSagas(typeof(MySaga).Assembly);\n\nThe example above uses the assembly scanning DbContext implementation, which you can find in this gist.\n"},"usage/containers/ninject.html":{"url":"usage/containers/ninject.html","title":"Ninject","keywords":"","body":"Configuring Ninject\nThe following example shows how to configure a simple Ninject container, and include the bus in the\ncontainer.

In a distributed system, this can increase the latency of an application since the service may be hosted in another process, on another machine, or may even be a remote service in another network. While in many cases it is best to avoid request/response use in distributed applications, particularly when the request is a command, it is often necessary and preferred over more complex solutions.\nFortunately for .NET developers, C# with TPL makes it easier to program applications that call services asynchronously. By using Tasks and the async and await keywords, developers can write procedural code and avoid the complex use of callbacks and handlers. Additionally, multiple asynchronous requests can be executed at once, reducing the overall execution time to that of the longest request.\nCreating the message contracts\nTo get started, the message contracts need to be created. In this example, an order status check is being created.\npublic interface CheckOrderStatus\n{\n    string OrderId { get; }\n}\n\npublic interface OrderStatusResult\n{\n    string OrderId { get; }\n    DateTime Timestamp { get; }\n    short StatusCode { get; }\n    string StatusText { get; }\n}\n\nHandling requests\nIn order for the request to return anything, it needs to be handled. Handling requests is done by using normal consumers. The only difference is that such consumer needs to send a response back.\nFor the aforementioned message contracts, the request handler can look like this:\npublic class CheckOrderStatusConsumer : \n    IConsumer\n{\n    readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;\n\n    public CheckOrderStatusConsumer(IOrderRepository orderRepository)\n    {\n        _orderRepository = orderRepository;\n    }\n\n    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        var order = await _orderRepository.Get(context.Message.OrderId);\n        if (order == null)\n            throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Order not found\");\n\n        await context.RespondAsync(new \n        {\n            OrderId = order.Id,\n            order.Timestamp,\n            order.StatusCode,\n            order.StatusText\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nThe response will be sent back to the requestor. In case the exception is thrown, MassTransit will create a Fault message and send it back to the requestor. The requestor address is available in the consume context of the request message as context.ResponseAddress.\nCreating the request client\nMost interactions of the request/response nature consist of four elements: the request arguments, the response values, exception handling, and the time to wait for a response. The .NET framework gives us one additional element, a CancellationToken which can prematurely cancel waiting for the response.\nIn MassTransit, the request client is composed of two parts, a client factory, and a request client. The client factory is created from the bus, or a connected endpoint, and has the interface below (some overloads are omitted, but you get the idea).\npublic interface IClientFactory \n{\n    IRequestClient CreateRequestClient(ConsumeContext context, Uri destinationAddress, RequestTimeout timeout);\n\n    IRequestClient CreateRequestClient(Uri destinationAddress, RequestTimeout timeout);\n\n    RequestHandle CreateRequest(T request, Uri destinationAddress, CancellationToken cancellationToken, RequestTimeout timeout);\n\n    RequestHandle CreateRequest(ConsumeContext context, T request, Uri destinationAddress, CancellationToken cancellationToken, RequestTimeout timeout);\n}\n\nAs shown, the client factory can create a request client, or it can create a request directly. There are advantages to each approach, although it's typically best to create a request client and use it if possible. If a consumer is sending the request, a new client should be created for each message (and is handled automatically if you're using a dependency injection container and the container registration methods).\nTo create a client factory, call bus.CreateClientFactory or host.CreateClientFactory -- after the bus has been started.\nThe request client can be used to create requests (returning a RequestHandle, which must be disposed after the request completes) or it can be used directly to send a request and get a response (asynchronously, of course).\n\nUsing Create returns a request handle, which can be used to set headers and other attributes of the request before it is sent.\n\npublic interface IRequestClient\n    where TRequest : class\n{\n    RequestHandle Create(TRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken, RequestTimeout timeout);\n\n    Task> GetResponse(TRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken, RequestTimeout timeout);\n}\n\nUsing the request client\nTo create a request client, and use it to make a standalone request (not from a consumer, API controller, etc.):\nvar serviceAddress = new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/check-order-status\");\nvar client = bus.CreateRequestClient(serviceAddress);\n\nvar response = await client.GetResponse(new { OrderId = id});\n\nThe response type, Response includes the MessageContext from when the response was received, providing access to the message properties (such as response.ConversationId) and headers (response.Headers). \nTo create a request, and add a header to the SendContext, use the Create method which returns a RequestHandle and then set the header using an execute filter as shown.\nusing (var request = client.Create(new { OrderId = id})\n{\n    request.UseExecute(x => x.Headers.Set(\"custom-header\", \"some-value\"));\n\n    var response = await request.GetResponse();\n}\n\nCalling the GetResponse method triggers the request to be sent, after which the caller awaits the response. To add additional response types, see below for the tuple syntax, or just add multiple GetResponse methods, passing false for the readyToSend parameter.\nSee below for examples of how to use the request client in different contexts.\n\nImportant: MassTransit uses a temporary non-durable queue and has a consumer to handle responses. This temporary queue only get configured and created when you start the bus. If you forget to start the bus in your application code, the request client will fail with a timeout, waiting for a response.\n\nUsing the request client in ASP.NET\nTo register a request client for use with ASP.NET Core, it is recommended to use the MassTransit.ExtensionsDependencyInjection NuGet package. It can be used to setup ASP.NET to use MassTransit, and has registration methods to ensure consumers and request clients are properly registered.\nTo configure the request client in ASP.NET, use the registration extension shown.\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n{\n    services.AddMassTransit(x =>\n    {\n        x.AddConsumer();\n\n        x.AddBus(provider => Bus.Factory.CreateUsingInMemory(cfg =>\n        {\n            cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(provider);\n        }));\n\n        x.AddRequestClient();\n    }));\n}\n\nOnce registered, a controller can use the client via a constructor dependency.\npublic class RequestController :\n    Controller\n{\n    IRequestClient _client;\n\n    public RequestController(IRequestClient client)\n    {\n        _client = client;\n    }\n\n    public async Task Get(string id)\n    {\n        var response = await _client.GetResponse(new {OrderId = id});\n\n        return View(response.Message);\n    }\n}\n\nThe controller method will send the command, and return the view once the result has been received.\nComposing multiple requests\nIf there were multiple requests to be performed, it is easy to wait on all results at the same time, benefiting from the concurrent operation.\npublic class RequestController : \n    Controller\n{\n    IRequestClient _clientA;\n    IRequestClient _clientB;\n\n    public RequestController(IRequestClient clientA, IRequestClient clientB)\n    {\n        _clientA = clientA;\n        _clientB = clientB;\n    }\n\n    public async Task Get()\n    {\n        var resultA = _clientA.GetResponse(new RequestA());\n        var resultB = _clientB.GetResponse(new RequestB());\n\n        await Task.WhenAll(resultA, resultB);\n\n        var a = await resultA;\n        var b = await resultB;\n\n        var model = new Model(a.Message, b.Message);\n\n        return View(model);\n    }\n}\n\nThe power of concurrency, for the win!\nReturning multiple response types\nAnother powerful feature with the request client is the ability support multiple (such as positive and negative) result types. For example, adding an OrderNotFound response type to the consumer as shown eliminates throwing an exception since a missing order isn't really a fault.\npublic class CheckOrderStatusConsumer : \n    IConsumer\n{\n    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        var order = await _orderRepository.Get(context.Message.OrderId);\n        if (order == null)\n            await context.RespondAsync(context.Message);\n        else        \n            await context.RespondAsync(new \n            {\n                OrderId = order.Id,\n                order.Timestamp,\n                order.StatusCode,\n                order.StatusText\n            });\n    }\n}\n\nThe client can now wait for multiple response types (in this case, two) by using a little tuple magic.\nvar (statusResponse,notFoundResponse) = await client.GetResponse(new { OrderId = id});\n\n// both tuple values are Task>, need to find out which one completed\nif(statusResponse.IsCompletedSuccessfully)\n{\n    var orderStatus = await statusResponse;\n    // do something\n}\nelse\n{\n    var notFound = await notFoundResponse;\n    // do something else\n}\n\nThis cleans up the processing, an eliminates the need to catch a RequestFaultException.\n"},"usage/exceptions.html":{"url":"usage/exceptions.html","title":"Handle exceptions","keywords":"","body":"Handling exceptions\nLet's face it, bad things happen. Networks partition, servers crash, remote endpoints become non-responsive. And when bad things happen, exceptions get thrown. And when exceptions get thrown, people die. Okay, maybe that's a bit dramatic, but the point is, exceptions are a fact of software development.\nFortunately, MassTransit provides a number of features to help your application recover from and deal with exceptions. But before getting into that, an understanding of what happens when a message is consumed is needed.\nTake, for example, a consumer that simply throws an exception.\npublic class SubmitOrderConsumer :\n    IConsumer\n{\n    public Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        throw new Exception(\"Very bad things happened\");\n    }\n}\n\nWhen a message is delivered to the consumer, the consumer throws an exception. With a default bus configuration, the exception is caught by middleware in the transport (the ErrorTransportFilter to be exact), and the message is moved to an _error queue (prefixed by the receive endpoint queue name). The exception details are stored as headers with the message for analysis and to assist in troubleshooting the exception.\n\nIn addition to moving the message to an error queue, MassTransit also produces a Fault event. See below for more details on faults.\n\nRetrying messages\nIn some cases, the exception may be a transient condition, such as a database deadlock, a busy web service, or some similar type of situation which usually clears up on a second attempt. With these exception types, it is often desirable to retry the message delivery to the consumer, allowing the consumer to try the operation again.\npublic class SubmitOrderConsumer :\n    IConsumer\n{\n    ISessionFactory _sessionFactory;\n\n    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        using(var session = _sessionFactory.OpenSession())\n        using(var transaction = session.BeginTransaction())\n        {\n            var customer = session.Get(context.Message.CustomerId);\n\n            // continue with order processing\n\n            transaction.Commit();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWith this consumer, an ADOException can be thrown, say there is a deadlock or the SQL server is unavailable. In this case, the operation should be retried before moving the message to the error queue. This can be configured on the receive endpoint or the consumer. Shown below is a retry policy which attempts to deliver the message to a consumer five times before throwing the exception back up the pipeline.\nvar sessionFactory = CreateSessionFactory();\n\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = cfg.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/\"), h =>\n    {\n        h.Username(\"guest\");\n        h.Password(\"guest\");\n    });\n\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"submit-order\", e =>\n    {\n        e.UseMessageRetry(r => r.Immediate(5));\n        e.Consumer(() => new SubmitOrderConsumer(sessionFactory));\n    });\n});\n\nThe UseMessageRetry method is an extension method that configures a middleware filter, in this case the RetryFilter. There are a variety of retry policies available, which are detailed in the reference section.\n\nNote:\n    In this example, the UseMessageRetry is at the receive endpoint level. Additional retry filters can be added at the bus and consumer level, providing flexibility in how different consumers, messages, etc. are retried.\n\n\nMassTransit retry filters execute in memory and maintain a lock on the message. As such, they should only be used to handle short, transient error conditions. Setting a retry interval of an hour would fall into the category of bad things. To retry messages after longer waits, look at the next section on redelivering messages.\nRedelivering messages\nSome errors take a while to resolve, say a remote service is down or a SQL server has crashed. In these situations, it's best to dust off and nuke the site from orbit - at a much later time obviously. Redelivery is a form of retry (some refer to it as second-level retry) where the message is removed from the queue and then redelivered to the queue at a future time.\nTo add message redelivery, first, the bus must be configured with a message scheduler (see the scheduling section for more details). With a scheduler configured, the above example that only used retry can be modified to add scheduled redelivery as shown below.\nvar sessionFactory = CreateSessionFactory();\n\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = cfg.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/\"), h =>\n    {\n        h.Username(\"guest\");\n        h.Password(\"guest\");\n    });\n\n    cfg.UseMessageScheduler(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/quartz\"));\n\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"submit-order\", e =>\n    {\n        e.UseScheduledRedelivery(r => r.Intervals(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5), TimeSpan.FromMinutes(15), TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30)));\n        e.UseMessageRetry(r => r.Immediate(5));\n        e.Consumer(() => new SubmitOrderConsumer(sessionFactory));\n    });\n});\n\nNow, if the initial 5 immediate retries fail (the database is really, really down), the message will retry an additional three times after 5, 15, and 30 minutes. This could mean a total of 15 retry attempts (on top of the initial 4 attempts prior to the retry/redelivery filters taking control).\nAdding an outbox\nIf the consumer publishes events or sends messages (using ConsumeContext, which is provided via the Consume method on the consumer) and subsequently throws an exception, it isn't likely that those messages should still be published or sent. MassTransit provides an outbox to buffer those messages until the consumer completes successfully. If an exception is thrown, the buffered messages are discarded.\nTo configure the outbox with redelivery and retry:\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"submit-order\", e =>\n    {\n        e.UseScheduledRedelivery(r => r.Intervals(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5), TimeSpan.FromMinutes(15), TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30)));\n        e.UseMessageRetry(r => r.Immediate(5));\n        e.UseInMemoryOutbox();\n\n        e.Consumer(() => new SubmitOrderConsumer(sessionFactory));\n    });\n});\n\nConfiguring for a consumer or saga\nIf there are multiple consumers (or saga) on the same endpoint (which could potentially get you on the naughty list), and the retry/redelivery behavior should only apply to a specific consumer or saga, the same configuration can be applied specifically to the consumer or saga.\nTo configure a specific consumer.\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"submit-order\", e =>\n    {\n        e.Consumer(() => new SubmitOrderConsumer(sessionFactory), c =>\n        {\n            c.UseScheduledRedelivery(r => r.Intervals(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5), TimeSpan.FromMinutes(15), TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30)));\n            c.UseMessageRetry(r => r.Immediate(5));\n            c.UseInMemoryOutbox();\n        });\n    });\n});\n\nSagas are configured in the same way, using the saga configurator.\nHandling faults\nAs shown above, MassTransit delivers messages to consumers by calling the Consume method. When a message consumer throws an exception instead of returning normally, a Fault is produced, which may be published or sent depending upon the context.\nA Fault is a generic message contract including the original message that caused the consumer to fail, as well as the ExceptionInfo, HostInfo, and the time of the exception.\npublic interface Fault\n    where T : class\n{\n    Guid FaultId { get; }\n    Guid? FaultedMessageId { get; }\n    DateTime Timestamp { get; }\n    ExceptionInfo[] Exceptions { get; }\n    HostInfo Host { get; }\n    T Message { get; }\n}\n\nIf the message headers specify a FaultAddress, the fault is sent directly to that address. If the FaultAddress is not present, but a ResponseAddress is specified, the fault is sent to the response address. Otherwise, the fault is published, allowing any subscribed consumers to receive it.\nConsuming faults\nDevelopers may want to do something with faults, such as updating an operational dashboard. To observe faults separate of the consumer that caused the fault to be produced, a consumer can consume fault messages the same as any other message.\npublic class DashboardFaultConsumer :\n    IConsumer>\n{\n    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext> context)\n    {\n        // update the dashboard\n    }\n}\n\nFaults can also be observed by state machines when specified as an event:\nEvent(() => SubmitOrderFaulted, \n    x => x.CorrelateById(m => m.Message.Message.OrderId)\n    .SelectId(m => m.Message.Message.OrderId));\n\npublic Event> SubmitOrderFaulted { get; private set; }\n\n"},"usage/retries.html":{"url":"usage/retries.html","title":"Configure retries","keywords":"","body":"Configuring Retry\n\nMore detail on handling exceptions is available at the Handling exceptions page.\n\nErrors happen, and when they do it's important to handle those errors gracefully. In a distributed system, transient errors can occur for a variety of reasons, such a network glitches, service restarts, etc. To handle those types of errors, MassTransit has the ability to retry messages.\nTo configure message retry on a receive endpoint:\nBus.Factory.CreateUsingInMemory(cfg =>\n{\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(\"input-queue\", e =>\n    {\n        e.UseMessageRetry(r => r.Interval(3, 1000));\n\n        e.Consumer();\n    });\n});\n\n\nThe order matters, so make sure the UseMessageRetry statement is before any consumer statements.\n\nIn the above configuration, if MyConsumer throws an exception while processing a message, the message will be delivered to a new consumer again after one second, and that will repeat up to three times before generating a fault and moving the message to the error queue.\nAdding an outbox\nIf the consumer publishes events or sends messages (using ConsumeContext, which is provided via the Consume method on the consumer) and subsequently throws an exception, it isn't likely that those messages should still be published or sent. MassTransit provides an outbox to buffer those messages until the consumer completes successfully.

With no argument, all exceptions of specified type will be either handled or ignored. You can also specify a function argument that will filter exceptions further based on other parameters.\n\nNon-generic version that needs one or more exception types as parameters. No further filtering is possible if this version is used.\n\n\nYou can use multiple calls to these methods to specify filters for multiple exception types:\ne.UseMessageRetry(r => \n{\n    r.Handle();\n    r.Ignore(typeof(InvalidOperationException), typeof(InvalidCastException));\n    r.Ignore(t => t.ParamName == \"orderTotal\");\n});\n\nYou can also specify multiple retry policies for a single endpoint:\nBus.Factory.CreateUsingInMemory(cfg =>\n{\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(\"input-queue\", e =>\n    {\n        e.UseMessageRetry(r => \n        {\n            r.Immediate(5);\n            r.Handle(x => x.Message.Contains(\"SQL\"));\n        });\n        e.Consumer(c => c.UseMessageRetry(r => \n            {\n                r.Interval(10, TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(200));\n                r.Ignore();\n                r.Ignore(x => x.Message.Contains(\"SQL\"));\n            });\n        );\n    });\n});\n\nIn the above example, if the consumer throws an ArgumentNullException it won't be retried (because it would obvious fail again, most likely). If a DataException is thrown matching the filter expression, it wouldn't be handled by the second retry filter, but would be handled by the first retry filter.\nPrevious Retry Configurations\nThere are previous configuration of retry that are still supported. However, it's encouraged that the above methods be used to configure message-level retry.\nRetry policies\nThe retry policy can be specified at the bus level, as well as the endpoint and consumer level. The policy closest to the exception is the policy that is used.\nTo configure the default retry policy for the entire bus.\nBus.Factory.CreateUsingInMemory(cfg =>\n{\n    cfg.UseRetry(r => r.None());\n});\n\nTo configure the retry policy for a receive endpoint.\nBus.Factory.CreateUsingInMemory(cfg =>\n{\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(\"inbound\", ep =>\n    {\n        ep.UseRetry(r => r.Immediate(5));\n    });\n});\n\nTo configure the retry policy for a specific consumer on an endpoint.\nBus.Factory.CreateUsingInMemory(cfg =>\n{\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(\"inbound\", ep =>\n    {\n        ep.Consumer(cc =>\n        {\n            cc.UseRetry(r => r.Interval(10, TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(200)));\n        });\n    });\n});\n\n"},"usage/message-data.html":{"url":"usage/message-data.html","title":"Large payloads","keywords":"","body":"Message Data\nMessage brokers are built to be fast, and larger message sizes can affect broker performance.

For example, to schedule a message for future delivery from within a message consumer.\npublic class ScheduleNotificationConsumer :\n    IConsumer\n{\n    Uri _schedulerAddress;\n    Uri _notificationService;\n\n    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        if(context.Message.ReservationTime - DateTime.Now \nThis will schedule the message to be delivered to the consumer endpoint at the specified time.\n\nIf the message should be sent to a different endpoint, the destination address can be specified as an additional parameter.\n\n"},"usage/scheduling/rabbitmq-delayed.html":{"url":"usage/scheduling/rabbitmq-delayed.html","title":"RabbitMQ Delayed Exchange","keywords":"","body":"RabbitMQ Delayed Exchange\nRabbitMQ has no native support for deferred dispatch. However, the community has developed a plugin that makes such functionality possible, enabling native support for message scheduling for RabbitMQ.\nThis plugin is still considered as experimental. It is supported by MassTransit, but we cannot guarantee anything more than the plugin guarantees itself. Please read the message on the plugin project home page to get full understanding of the current status and limitations.\nThe plugin is not included in the RabbitMQ distribution. Please follow the instructions on the project wiki to install it.\nScheduling messages\nYou can use the delayed exchange to scheduled messages instead of Quartz. To enable this, you need to configure your bus properly:\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    cfg.UseDelayedExchangeMessageScheduler();\n\n    var host = cfg.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/\"), h =>\n    {\n        h.Username(\"guest\");\n        h.Password(\"guest\");\n    });\n}\n\nImportant: there is no support for unscheduling messages that are scheduled with the delayed exchange.\nRedelivery\nYou also can use the delayed exchange to implement message redelivery (second-level retries). All you need to do is to call the context.Defer(TimeSpan delay) method in your consumer.\npublic async Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n{\n    try\n    {\n        // process message\n    }\n    catch (MyTemporaryException e)\n    {\n        // we will try again later\n        context.Defer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));\n    }\n}\n\nRead more about message redelivery in Redelivering messages\n"},"usage/scheduling/redeliver.html":{"url":"usage/scheduling/redeliver.html","title":"Redelivering messages","keywords":"","body":"Redelivering messages\n\nThis page may be removed in the future, for more detail on handling exceptions is available at the Handling exceptions page.\n\nThere are situations where a message cannot be processed, either due to an unavailable resource or a situation in which message ordering is important (you should try not to depend upon message order, but sometimes it is an easy workaround). In these situations, scheduling a message for redelivery is a powerful tool.\nRetry using scheduled redelivery\nHandling exceptions (described in detail on the page linked above) includes the ability to use scheduled redelivery for longer retry delays when immediate or short delay retries fail.\nExplicit message redelivery\nMassTransit makes it easy to schedule messages for redelivery. In the example below, the Quartz service is running as a separate service on the /quartz queue.\npublic class UpdateCustomerAddressConsumer :\n    IConsumer\n{\n    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            // try to update the database\n        }\n        catch (CustomerNotFoundException exception)\n        {\n            // schedule redelivery in one minute\n            context.Redeliver(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nTo enable the Redeliver method, the Quartz endpoint must be setup on the bus.\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = cfg.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/\"), h =>\n    {\n        h.Username(\"guest\");\n        h.Password(\"guest\");\n    });\n\n    cfg.UseMessageScheduler(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/quartz\"));\n});\n\nRedelivery with RabbitMQ\nIt is also possible to use RabbitMQ Delayed Exchange to redeliver messages. You can even use it if the delayed exchange is not configured as a default message scheduler.\nYou can schedule a message to be redelivered via RabbitMQ delayed exchange from a consumer by using the Defer extension method like this:\npublic async Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n{\n    try\n    {\n        // try to update the database\n    }\n    catch (CustomerNotFoundException exception)\n    {\n        // schedule redelivery in one minute\n        context.Defer(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));\n    }\n}\n\nThe redelivered message includes two additional message headers:\nMT-Redelivery-Count\n  The number of redelivery attempts the message has had. The first attempt is number 1.\nMT-Scheduling-DeliveredAddress\n  The address where the message was last delivered and subsequently scheduled for redelivery.\n"},"usage/observers.html":{"url":"usage/observers.html","title":"Observe messages","keywords":"","body":"Observing messages\nMassTransit supports a number of message observes, making it possible to monitoring when messages are received, consumed, sent, and published. Each type of observer is configured separately, keeping the interfaces lean and\nfocused.\n\nWarning:\n    Observers should not be used to modify or intercept messages. To intercept messages (either to add headers,or modify the message contents), create a new or use an existing middleware component.\n\n\nObserving received messages\nTo observe received messages immediately after they are delivered by the transport, create a class that implements the IReceiveObserver interface, and connect it to the bus as shown below.\npublic class ReceiveObserver : IReceiveObserver\n{    \n    public Task PreReceive(ReceiveContext context)\n    {\n        // called immediately after the message was delivery by the transport\n    }\n\n    public Task PostReceive(ReceiveContext context)\n    {\n        // called after the message has been received and processed\n    }\n\n    public Task PostConsume(ConsumeContext context, TimeSpan duration, string consumerType)\n        where T : class\n    {\n        // called when the message was consumed, once for each consumer\n    }\n\n    public Task ConsumeFault(ConsumeContext context, TimeSpan elapsed, string consumerType, Exception exception) where T : class\n    {\n        // called when the message is consumed but the consumer throws an exception\n    }\n\n    public Task ReceiveFault(ReceiveContext context, Exception exception)\n    {\n        // called when an exception occurs early in the message processing, such as deserialization, etc.\n    }\n}\n\nThen connect the observer to the bus before starting it, as shown.\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = cfg.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/\"), h =>\n    {\n        h.Username(\"guest\");\n        h.Password(\"guest\");\n    });\n\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"customer_update_queue\", e =>\n    {\n        e.Consumer();\n    });\n});\n\nvar observer = new ReceiveObserver();\nvar handle = busControl.ConnectReceiveObserver(observer);\n\nObserving consumed messages\nIf the receive context isn't super interesting, perhaps the actual consumption of messages might float your boat. A consume observer implements the IConsumeObserver interface, as shown below.\npublic class ConsumeObserver : IConsumeObserver\n{    \n    Task IConsumeObserver.PreConsume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        // called before the consumer's Consume method is called\n    }\n\n    Task IConsumeObserver.PostConsume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        // called after the consumer's Consume method is called\n        // if an exception was thrown, the ConsumeFault method is called instead\n    }\n\n    Task IConsumeObserver.ConsumeFault(ConsumeContext context, Exception exception)\n    {\n        // called if the consumer's Consume method throws an exception\n    }\n}\n\nTo connect the observer, use the ConnectConsumeObserver method before starting the bus.\nObserving specific consumed messages\nOkay, so it's obvious that if you've read this far you want a more specific observer, one that only is called when a specific message type is consumed. We have you covered there too, as shown below.\npublic class ConsumeObserver : IConsumeMessageObserver where T : class\n{\n    Task IConsumeMessageObserver.PreConsume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        // called before the consumer's Consume method is called\n    }\n\n    Task IConsumeMessageObserver.PostConsume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        // called after the consumer's Consume method was called\n        // again, exceptions call the Fault method.\n    }\n\n    Task IConsumeMessageObserver.ConsumeFault(ConsumeContext context, Exception exception)\n    {\n        // called when a consumer throws an exception consuming the message\n    }\n}\n\nTo connect the observer, use the ConnectConsumeMessageObserver method before starting the bus.\nObserving sent messages\nOkay, so, incoming messages are not your thing. We get it, you're all about what goes out. It's cool. It's better to send than to receive. Or is that give? Anyway, a send observer is also available.\npublic class SendObserver : ISendObserver\n{\n    public Task PreSend(SendContext context)\n        where T : class\n    {\n        // called just before a message is sent, all the headers should be setup and everything\n    }\n\n    public Task PostSend(SendContext context)\n        where T : class\n    {\n        // called just after a message it sent to the transport and acknowledged (RabbitMQ)\n    }\n\n    public Task SendFault(SendContext context, Exception exception)\n        where T : class\n    {\n        // called if an exception occurred sending the message\n    }\n}\n\nTo connect the observer, you already guessed it, use the ConnectSendObserver method before starting the bus.\nObserving published messages\nIn addition to send, publish is also observable. Because the semantics matter, absolutely. Using the MessageId to link them up as it's unique for each message. Remember that Publish and Send are two distinct operations so if you want to observe all messages that are leaving your service, you have to connect both Publish and Send observers.\npublic class PublishObserver : IPublishObserver\n{\n    public Task PrePublish(PublishContext context)\n        where T : class\n    {\n        // called right before the message is published (sent to exchange or topic)\n    }\n\n    public Task PostPublish(PublishContext context)\n        where T : class\n    {\n        // called after the message is published (and acked by the broker if RabbitMQ)\n    }\n\n    public Task PublishFault(PublishContext context, Exception exception)\n        where T : class\n    {\n        // called if there was an exception publishing the message\n    }\n}\n\nFinally, to connect the observer, use the ConnectPublishObserver method before starting the bus.\nThese are a ton of interfaces, and they offer a lot of information about how the system is behaving under the hood. So use them, abuse them, bend them, and break them. Just realize, they are immediate, so don't be slow or your messaging will be equally slow.\n"},"usage/lifecycle-observers.html":{"url":"usage/lifecycle-observers.html","title":"Observe lifecycle","keywords":"","body":"Observing lifecycle events\nWhen integrating a framework into your application, it can be useful to understand when the framework is \"doing stuff.\"\nWhether it is starting up, shutting down, or anything in between, being notified and thereby able to take action is a\nhuge benefit.\nMassTransit supports a number of lifecycle events that can be observed, making it easy to build components that are\nstarted and stopped along with the bus.\n\nNote:\n    A good example of this is the UseInMemoryMessageScheduler, which is part of the Quartz.NET integration\n    package. Using the lifecycle events, Quartz is able to be started and stopped on a receive endpoint without\n    any additional development.

In the above, the properties of the instance are initialized, and then the CartExpired event is scheduled, after which the state is set to Active.\n    During(Active,\n        When(Submitted)\n            .Then(context =>\n            {\n                if (context.Data.Timestamp > context.Instance.Updated)\n                    context.Instance.Updated = context.Data.Timestamp;\n                context.Instance.OrderId = context.Data.OrderId;\n            })\n            .ThenAsync(context => \n                Console.Out.WriteLineAsync(\n                    $\"Cart Submitted: {context.Data.UserName} to {context.Instance.CorrelationId}\"))\n            .Unschedule(CartExpired)\n            .TransitionTo(Ordered),\n\nWhile the shopping cart is active, if the order is submitted, the expiration is canceled (via Unschedule) and the state is set to Ordered.\n            When(ItemAdded)\n                .Then(context =>\n                {\n                    if (context.Data.Timestamp > context.Instance.Updated)\n                        context.Instance.Updated = context.Data.Timestamp;\n                })\n                .ThenAsync(context => \n                    Console.Out.WriteLineAsync(\n                        $\"Item Added: {context.Data.UserName} to {context.Instance.CorrelationId}\"))\n                .Schedule(CartExpired, context => new CartExpiredEvent(context.Instance)),\n\nIf another item is added to the cart, the CartExpired event is scheduled, and the existence of a previously scheduled event (via the ExpirationId property) is used to cancel the previously scheduled event.\n        When(CartExpired.Received)\n            .ThenAsync(context => Console.Out.WriteLineAsync(\n                $\"Item Expired: {context.Instance.CorrelationId}\"))\n            .Publish(context => new CartRemovedEvent(context.Instance))\n            .Finalize()\n        );\n\nIf the CartExpired event is received, the cart removed event is published and the shopping cart is finalized.\n        SetCompletedWhenFinalized();\n    }\n\nSignals that the state machine instance should be deleted if it is finalized. This is used to tell Entity Framework to delete the row from the database.\n    public State Active { get; private set; }\n    public State Ordered { get; private set; }\n\nThe states of the shopping cart (Initial and Final are built-in states).\n    public Schedule CartExpired { get; private set; }\n\nThe schedule definition for the CartExpired event.\n    public Event ItemAdded { get; private set; }\n    public Event Submitted { get; private set; }\n}\n\nThe events that are observed by the state machine (the correlations are defined earlier in the state machine).\nThe state machine is generic, and requires a state class (because sagas are stateful), so that is defined below. The state class has the values that are persisted between events.\nclass ShoppingCartState :\n    SagaStateMachineInstance\n{\n    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }\n\nThe CorrelationId is the primary key of the saga state instance. It is assigned either from a property on the initial message that creates the saga instance, or can be generated using NewId.NextGuid(), which ensures a nice ordered sequential identifier.\n    public string CurrentState { get; set; }\n\nThe current state of the saga, which can be saved as a string or an int, depending upon your database requirements. An int is smaller, but requires that all valid states be mapped to integers during the definition of the state machine.\n    public Guid? ExpirationId { get; set; }\n\nThis is an identifier that is used by the state machine's scheduling feature, to capture the scheduled message identifier. Message scheduling within sagas is a powerful feature, which is described later.\n    public string UserName { get; set; }\n\n    public DateTime Created { get; set; }\n    public DateTime Updated { get; set; }\n\n    public Guid? OrderId { get; set; }\n}\n\nThe remainder of the properties are relevant to the application, and are saved when properly mapped using the saga repository (which can be any supported storage engine, Entity Framework and NHibernate are supported out of the box).\nConnecting the saga to a receive endpoint\nTo connect the state machine saga to a receive endpoint, a saga repository is used, along with the state machine instance.\nvar repository = new InMemorySagaRepository();\n\n_busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(x =>\n{\n    IRabbitMqHost host = x.Host(...);\n\n    x.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"shopping_cart_state\", e =>\n    {\n        e.PrefetchCount = 8;\n        e.StateMachineSaga(_machine, repository);\n    });\n\n    x.UseInMemoryMessageScheduler(); // for testing, to make it easy\n});\n\nCombining events (think Fork/Join)\nMultiple events can be combined into a single event, for the purposes of joining together multiple operations. To define a combined event, the Event syntax has an overload.\n    public Event Ready { get; private set; }\n    public Event Approved { get; private set; }\n    public Event Verified { get; private set; }\n\n    CompositeEvent(() => OrderReady, x => x.OrderReadyStatus, PaymentApproved, StockVerified);\n\nOnce both events have been delivered to the state machine, the third event, OrderReady, will be triggered.\n\nNote:\n    The order of events being declared can impact the order in which they execute. Therefore, it is best to declare composite events at the end of the state machine declaration, after all other events and behaviors are declared. That way, the composite events will be raised after the dependent event behaviors.\n\n\n\nIgnoring events\nIn some cases you may want to ignore events, which can not be handled by the saga, because of inapropriate state. Without additional configuration handling of such events end with exception and messages being moved to the error queue. State machine can be configured to ignore events if they can not be handled. This can be done with the use of Ignore() method:\n    public State Intermediate { get; set; }\n    public Event Start { get; private set; }\n\n    public MyMachine()\n    {\n        Initially(\n            When(Start)\n                .ThenAsync(context => Console.Out.WriteAsync(\"Initially\"))\n                .TransitionTo(Intermediate)\n            );\n\n        During(Intermediate,\n            When(AllowedEvent)\n                .Then(context => Console.Out.WriteAsync(\"AllowedEvent\"))\n                .TransitionTo(SomeState),\n            Ignore(Start)\n            );\n    }\n\nIn the example above MyMachine will only handle Start event in Initial state. If Start event is correlated with the saga, which is in the state Intermediate, such event will be ignored without moving message to the error queue.\nAnother approach to configure ignorance is to use Ignore() method inside DuringAny(). This approach is more suitable when a sufficiently large number of states is defined:\n    public State Intermediate { get; set; }\n    public State AnotherState { get; set; }\n    public State SomeAnotherState { get; set; }\n    public Event Start { get; private set; }\n\n    public MyMachine()\n    {\n        DuringAny(Ignore(Start));\n\n        Initially(\n            When(Start)\n                .ThenAsync(context => Console.Out.WriteAsync(\"Initially\"))\n                .TransitionTo(Intermediate)\n            );\n\n        During(Intermediate,\n            When(AllowedEvent)\n                .Then(context => Console.Out.WriteAsync(\"AllowedEvent\"))\n            Ignore(Start)\n            );\n    }\n\nIn the example above MyMachine is configured to ignore Start event during any state, except Initial state.\n"},"advanced/sagas/persistence.html":{"url":"advanced/sagas/persistence.html","title":"Persistence","keywords":"","body":"Persisting Saga Instances\nSagas are stateful event-based message consumers -- they retain state. Therefore, saving state between events is important. Without persistent state, a saga would consider each event a new event, and orchestration of subsequent events would be meaningless.\n\nSpecifying saga persistence\nIdentity\nPublishing and Sending From Sagas\nStorage Engines\nEntity Framework\nMongoDB\nNHibernate\nRedis\nMarten\nDocumentDb\nAzure Service Bus\n\n\n\nSpecifying saga persistence\nIn order to store the saga state, you need to use one form of saga persistence. There are several types of storage that MassTransit supports, all of those, which are included to the main distribution, are listed below. There is also a in-memory unreliable storage, which allows to temporarily store your saga state. It is useful to try things out since it does not require any infrastructure.\nSimple initialization of a state machine saga with persistence looks like this:\nvar sagaStateMachine = new ShoppingCartStateMachine();\nvar repository = new InMemorySagaRepository();\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(x =>\n{\n    var host = x.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost\"), h =>\n    {\n        h.Username(\"guest\");\n        h.Password(\"guest\");\n    });\n\n    x.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"shopping_cart_state\", e =>\n    {\n        e.StateMachineSaga(sagaStateMachine, repository);\n    });\n});\n\nIt is important to notice that the saga repository object is a singleton. It does not hold any state inside the class instance and only performs operations on the saga state objects that are send to it to persist and retrieve.\nThere are two types of saga repository:\n\nQuery repository\nIdentity-only repository\n\nDepending on the persistence mechanism, repository implementation can be either identity-only or identity plus query.\nWhen using identity-only repository, such as Azure Service Bus message session or Redis, you can only use correlation by identity. This means that all events that the saga receives, must hold the saga correlation id, and the correlation for each event can only use CorrelateById method to define the correlation.\nQuery repository by definition support identity correlation too, but in addition support other properties of events being received and saga state properties. Such correlations are defined using CorrelateBy method and you can use any logical expression that involve the event data and saga state data to establish such correlation. Repository implementation such as Entity Framework, NHibernate and Marten support correlation by query. Of course, in-memory repository supports it as well.\nIdentity\nSaga instances are identified by a unique identifier (Guid), represented by the CorrelationId on the saga instance. Events are correlated to the saga instance using either the unique identifier, or alternatively using an expression that correlates properties on the saga instance to each event. If the CorrelationId is used, it's always a one-to-one match, either the saga already exists, or it's a new saga instance. With a correlation expression, the expression might match to more than one saga instance, so care should be used -- because the event would be delivered to all matching instances.\n\nSeriously, don't sent an event to all instances -- unless you want to watch your messages consumers lock your entire saga storage engine.\n\nIt is strongly advised to have CorrelationId as your table/document key. This will enable better concurrency handling and will make the saga state consistent.\nPublishing and Sending From Sagas\nSagas are completely message-driven and therefore not only consume but also publish events and send commands. However, if your saga received a lot of messages coming roughly at the same time and the endpoint is set to process multiple messages in parallel - this can lead to a conflict between message processing and saga persistence.\nThis means that there could be more than one saga state updates that are being persisted at the same time. Depending on the saga repository type, this might fail for different reasons - versioning issue, row or table lock or eTag mismatch. All those problems are basically saying that you are having a concurrency issue.\nIt is normal for the saga repository to throw an exception in such case but if your saga is publishing messages, they were already published but the saga state has not been updated. MassTransit will eventually use retry policy on the endpoint and more messages will be send, potentially leading to mess. Or, if there are no retry policies configured, messages might be sent indicating that the process needs to continue but saga instance will be in the old state and will not accept any further messages because they will come in a wrong state.\nThis issue is common and can be solved by postponing the message publish and send operations until all persistence work is done. All messages that should be published, are collected in a buffer, which is called Outbox. MassTransit implements this feature and it can be configured by adding these lines to your endpoint configuration:\nc.ReceiveEndpoint(\"queue\", e =>\n{\n    e.UseInMemoryOutbox();\n    // other endpoint configuration here\n}\n\nStorage Engines\nMassTransit supports several storage engines, including NHibernate, Entity Framework, MongoDB and Redis. Each of these are setup in a similar way, but examples are shown below for each engine.\n\nEntity Framework\nNHibernate\nMongoDB\nRedis\nMarten\nDocumentDb\nAzure Service Bus\nDapper\n\nRelational DB Recommendations\nWhile it's nice if you are developing a green-field system and you can define your Saga Db Entity with CorrelationId as the Primary Key (Clustered), sometimes we have to work within existing db entities. If this is the case, please remember in order to keep your saga's performing quickly (optimistic OR pessimistic, it doesn't matter), follow the note below.\n\nNote:\n    The CorrelationId should preferably be the Primary Key + Clustered for your saga table. If unable, then it must be a Clustered Index + Unique. And it's also highly recommended to use the NewId package for creating nice Db Friendly guids.\n\n\nOptimistic vs pessimistic concurrency\nMost persistence mechanisms for sagas supported by MassTransit need some way to guarantee ACID when processing sagas. Because there can be multiple threads consuming multiple bus events meant for the same saga instance, they could end up overwriting each other (race condition). \nRelational databases can easily handle this by setting the transaction type to serializable or (page/row) locking. This would be considered as pessimistic concurrency.\nAnother way to handle concurrency is to have some attribute like version or timestamp, which updates every time a saga is persisted. By doing that we can instruct the database only to update the record if this attribute matches between what we are trying to persist and what is stored in the database record we are trying to update.\nThis is type of concurrency is called an optimistic concurrency. It doesn't guarantee your unit of work with the database will succeed (must retry after these exceptions), but it also doesn't block anybody else from working within the same database page (not locking the table/page).\nSo, which one should I use?\nFor almost every scenario, it is recommended using the optimistic concurrency, because most state machine logic should be fairly quick.\nIf the chosen persistence method supports optimistic concurrency, race conditions can be handled rather easily by specifying a retry policy for concurrency exceptions or using generic retry policy.\nEntity Framework\nEntity Framework seems to be the most common ORM for class-SQL mappings, and SQL is still widely used for storing data. So it's a win to have it supported out of the box by MassTransit.\nConcurrency handling (for optimistic)\nFortunately, Entity Framework is a repository pattern itself, and has a column type [Timestamp] (a.k.a. IsRowVersion with fluent mapping), which will check the value of the column when it starts it's \"unit of work\" and if that value is the same when updating that row in the database - everybody is happy! But, if that column value is different, then it has been updated elsewhere. So, the Entity Framework will throw a DbUpdateConcurrencyException, which can be handled by a retry policyto fix the concurrency violation.\nConfiguration and usage\nThe code-first mapping example below shows the basics of getting started. The lines have been commented where the additional optimistic concurrency column is needed.\npublic class SagaInstance : SagaStateMachineInstance\n{\n    public SagaInstance(Guid correlationId)\n    {\n        CorrelationId = correlationId;\n    }\n\n    protected SagaInstance()\n    {\n    }\n\n    public string CurrentState { get; set; }\n    public string ServiceName { get; set; }\n    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }\n    public byte[] RowVersion { get; set; } // For Optimistic Concurrency, omit if using pessimistic\n}\n\npublic class SagaInstanceMap : SagaClassMapping\n{\n    public SagaInstanceMap()\n    {\n        Property(x => x.CurrentState);\n        Property(x => x.ServiceName, x => x.Length(40));\n        Property(x => x.RowVersion).IsRowVersion(); // For Optimistic Concurrency, omit if using pessimistic\n    }\n}\n\n\nImportant:\nThe SagaClassMapping has default mapping for the CorrelationId as a primary key. If you use your own mapping, you must follow the same convention, or at least make it a Clustered Index + Unique, otherwise there is a big chance to get deadlock exceptions and/or performance issues in case of high throughput.\n\nThe repository is then created on the context factory:\nSagaDbContextFactory contextFactory = () => \n    new SagaDbContext(_connectionString);\n\n// For Optimistic\nvar repository = new EntityFrameworkSagaRepository.CreateOptimistic(contextFactory);\n\n// For Pessimistic\nvar repository = new EntityFrameworkSagaRepository.CreatePessimistic(contextFactory);\n\nLastly, the snippet below is only needed for optimistic concurrency, because the saga should retry processing if failure occurred when writing to the database. This snippet is adding retry policies middleware to the saga receive endpoint from the first section.\nx.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"shopping_cart_state\", e =>\n{\n    e.UseRetry(x =>\n        {\n            x.Handle();\n            x.Handle(y => y.InnerException is SqlException e && e.Number == 2627); // This is the SQLServer error code for duplicate key, if you are using another Relational Db, the code might be different\n            x.Interval(5, TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(100)));\n        }); // Add the retry middleware for optimistic concurrency\n    e.StateMachineSaga(sagaStateMachine, repository);\n});\n\nHence, that if you have retry policy without an exception filter, it will also handle the concurrency exception, so explicit configuration is not required in this case.\nConsume Lifetime (Scoped) DBContext\nBy Default, EF Saga Pipeline will get it's own DBContext using the default implementation of ISagaDbContextFactory which is DelegateSagaDbContextFactory. This will not be shared if\nyou want to access the same dbContext from within a Saga. So you can implement a delegate factory which\nis scoped to the parent lifetime (the lifetime of the Saga Event Consumption).\nHere is how you would implement it for Autofac. Other containers would have a similar implementation.\npublic class AutofacSagaDbContextFactory :\n    ISagaDbContextFactory\n    where TSaga : class, ISaga\n{\n    readonly ILifetimeScope _defaultLifetimeScope;\n\n    public AutofacSagaDbContextFactory(ILifetimeScope defaultLifetimeScope)\n    {\n        _defaultLifetimeScope = defaultLifetimeScope;\n    }\n\n    public DbContext Create()\n    {\n        return _defaultLifetimeScope.Resolve();\n    }\n\n    public DbContext CreateScoped(ConsumeContext context)\n        where T : class\n    {            \n        if (context.TryGetPayload(out ILifetimeScope currentScope))\n            return currentScope.Resolve();\n\n        return Create();\n    }\n\n    public void Release(DbContext dbContext)\n    {\n        // Purposely left blank, the disposal of the dbContext is controlled by the container (autofac in this case)\n    }\n}\n\nMongoDB\nMongoDB is an easy to use saga repository, because setup is easy. There is no need for class mapping, the saga instances can be persisted easily using a MongoDB collection.\nConcurrency\nMongoDb saga persistence requires that saga instance classes implement IVersionedSaga interface. This interface has a Version property, which allows the saga persistence to handle optimistic concurrency.\nConfiguration and usage\npublic class SagaInstance : SagaStateMachineInstance, IVersionedSaga\n{\n    public SagaInstance(Guid correlationId)\n    {\n        CorrelationId = correlationId;\n    }\n\n    protected SagaInstance() { }\n\n    public string CurrentState { get; set; }\n    public string ServiceName { get; set; }\n    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }\n    public int Version { get; set; }\n}\n\nThe saga repository is created using the simple syntax:\nvar database = new MongoClient(\"mongodb://127.0.0.1\").GetDatabase(\"sagas\");\nvar repository = new MongoDbSagaRepository(database);\n\nEach saga instance will be placed in a collection specific to the instance type.\nNHibernate\nNHibernate is a widely used ORM and it is supported by MassTransit for saga storage. The example below shows the code-first approach to using NHibernate for saga persistence.\nConcurrency\nNHibernate natively supports multiple concurrency handling mechanisms. The easiest is probably adding a Version property of type int to the saga instance class and map it to the column with the same name. NHibernate will use it by default.\nConfiguration and usage\npublic class SagaInstance : SagaStateMachineInstance\n{\n    public SagaInstance(Guid correlationId)\n    {\n        CorrelationId = correlationId;\n    }\n\n    protected SagaInstance() { }\n\n    public string CurrentState { get; set; }\n    public string ServiceName { get; set; }\n    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }\n    public int Version { get; set; } // for optimistic concurrency\n}\n\npublic class SagaInstanceMap : SagaClassMapping\n{\n    public SagaInstanceMap()\n    {\n        Property(x => x.CurrentState);\n        Property(x => x.ServiceName, x => x.Length(40));\n        Property(x => x.Version); // for optimistic concurrency\n    }\n}\n\nThe SagaClassMapping base class maps the CorrelationId of the saga, and handles some of the basic bootstrapping of the class map. All other properties, including the property for the CurrentState (if you're using state machine sagas), must be mapped by the developer. Once mapped, the ISessionFactory can be created using NHibernate directly. From the session factory, the saga repository can be created.\n\nImportant:\nThe SagaClassMapping has default mapping for the CorrelationId as a database generated primary key. If you use your own mapping, you must follow the same convention, otherwise there is a big chance to get deadlock exceptions in case of high throughput.\n\nISessionFactory sessionFactory = CreateSessionFactory();\nvar repository = new NHibernateSagaRepository(sessionFactory);\n\nRedis\nRedis is a very popular key-value store, which is known for being very fast.\nRedis does not support queries, therefore Redis saga persistence only supports correlation by id. If you try to use correlation by expressions, you will get a \"not implemented\" exception.\nSaga persistence for Redis uses StackExchange.Redis library.\nRedis client initialization\nRedis saga repository is based on the popular StackExchange.Redis package and therefore requires StackExchange.Redis.IDatabase factory function as constructor parameter. For containerless initialization the code would look like:\nvar redisConnectionString = \"redis://localhost:6379\";\nvar redis = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(redisConnectionString);\n\nvar repository = new RedisSagaRepository(() => redis.GetDatabase());\n\nIf you use a container, you can use the code like this (example for Autofac):\nvar redisConnectionString = \"redis://localhost:6379\";\nbuilder.RegisterInstance(ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(redisConnectionString))\n    .As();\nbuilder.Register(c => c.Resolve.GetDatabase());\nbuilder.RegisterGeneric(typeof(RedisSagaRepository<>))\n    .As(typeof(ISagaRepository<>)).SingleInstance();\n\nConcurrency\nRedis persistence supports optimistic and pessimistic concurrency. The default mode is optomistic concurrency.\nIn optimistic concurrency mode, Redis saga persistence does not acquire locking on the database record when writing it so potentially you can have write conflict in case the saga is updating its state frequently (hundreds of times per second). To resolve this, the saga instance can implement the IVersionedSaga interface and include the Version property:\npublic int Version { get; set; }\n\nWhen the version of the instance that is being updated is lower than the expected version, the saga repository will trow an exception and force the message to be retried, potentially resolving the issue.\nPessimistic concurrency can be used by specifying optimistic: false parameter in the repository constructor. It will instruct the repository to use Redis lock mechanism. During the message processing, saga instance in Redis will be locked and any concurrent attempts to execute any processing on the same instance will fail.\nMarten\nMarten is an open-source library that provides an API to the PostgreSQL JSONB storage, influenced by RavenDb client API. It allows to use PostgreSQL as schema-less NoSQL document storage. Unlike typical document databases, PostgreSQL JSONB storage provides you the ACID-compliant transactional store with full consistency.\nTo use Marten and PostgreSQL as saga persistence, you need to install MassTransit.Marten NuGet package and add some code.\nFirst, your saga state class needs to mark the correlationId property with the [Identity] attribute. By this you inform Marten that correlationId will be used as the primary key.\npublic class SampleSaga : ISaga\n{\n    [Identity]\n    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }\n    public string State { get; set; }\n    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }\n}\n\nThen you need to initialize the document store and the repository. Repository needs the store as its constructor parameter.\nvar connectionString =\n    \"server=localhost;port=5432;database=test;user id=test;password=test;\";\nvar store = DocumentStore.For(connectionString);\nvar repository = new MartenSagaRepository(store);\n\nIf you use a container, you can use the code like this (example for Autofac):\nvar connectionString =\n    \"server=localhost;port=5432;database=test;user id=test;password=test;\";\nbuilder.Register(c => DocumentStore.For(connectionString);\nbuilder.RegisterGeneric(typeof(MartenSagaRepository<>))\n    .As(typeof(ISagaRepository<>)).SingleInstance();\n\nMarten will create the necessary tables for you. This type of saga repository supports correlation by id and custom expressions.\nConcurrency\nMarten supports optimistic concurrency by using an eTag-like version field in the metadata. This means that the saga instance class does not need any additional fields for version.\nThere are two ways to use this feature:\n1) Apply [UseOptimisticConcurrency] attribute to the saga instance class\n[UseOptimisticConcurrency]\npublic class SampleSaga : ISaga\n{\n    [Identity]\n    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }\n    ...\n}\n\n\nConfigure the store to use optimistic concurrency for your saga instance class\nvar store = DocumentStore.For(_ =>\n{\n  // Adds optimistic concurrency checking to Issue\n  _.Schema.For().UseOptimisticConcurrency(true);\n});\n\n\n\nDocumentDb\nDocumentDb is the precessor of Azure CosmosDb and the DocumentDb API is still one of the main APIs for the NoSQL document-oriented persistence of CosmosDb. MassTransit supports saga persistence in CosmosDb by using both MongoDb API (using MassTransit.MongoDb package) and using DocumentDb API (using MassTransit.DocumentDb package).\nDocumentDb requires that any document stored there has a property called id, to be used as the document identity. Saga instances have CorrelationId for the same purpose, so there are two ways to create your DocumentDb saga class, which can have different implications depending on your usage. ETag must also be present, which is used for optimistic concurrency. Please never set this property yourself, it managed 100% by document db.\nFirst, the simple (out of box) functionality. Create your saga class:\npublic class SampleSaga : IVersionedSaga\n{\n    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }\n    public string ETag { get; set; }\n    public string State { get; set; }\n    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }\n}\n\n// And in your bus/saga configuration, you explicitly pass in the settings\nvar repository = new DocumentDbSagaRepository(documentDbClient, \"sagaDatabase\", JsonSerializerSettingsExtensions.GetSagaRenameSettings());\n\nThe only restriction with this method is you might run into trouble if you are using Correlation Expressions that use the CorrelationId property. This is because when passing these expressions into DocumentDb's Create Query, it must have the [JsonProperty(\"id\")] attribute instead of using the JsonSerializerSettingsExtensions.GetSagaRenameSettings() rename.\nSo the second option for your saga class declaration is:\npublic class SampleSaga : IVersionedSaga\n{\n    [JsonProperty(\"id\")]\n    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }\n    [JsonProperty(\"_etag\")]\n    public string ETag { get; set; }\n    public string State { get; set; }\n    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }\n}\n\n// And in your bus/saga configuration, just follow the example below, no need to use the GetSagaRenameSettings<>()\n\nAnd optionally, you can make your Saga inherit from the Azure DocumentDb class Resource, because.. well why not? It's saving to that store, so you might as well have all the properties there anyways.\nThird option for saga class declaration:\npublic class SampleSaga : IVersionedSaga, Resource\n{\n    [JsonProperty(\"id\")] // This overrides the Resource [JsonProperty(\"id\")], which exists on the Resource classes Id property. This means Id will be a null guid, so just always use CorrelationId instead\n    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }\n    // The Resource class has the [JsonProperty(\"_etag\")] public string ETag {get;set;}, so we don't need to declare it here\n    public string State { get; set; }\n    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }\n}\n\n// And in your bus/saga configuration, just follow the example below, no need to use the GetSagaRenameSettings<>()\n\nSo my preference is option 3, or option 2. Option 1 is there to offer an option as backwards compatibility to existing functionality.\nInstantiation of the DocumentDb saga repository could be done like this:\nvar documentDbClient =  new DocumentClient(endpointUri, authKeyString);\nvar repository = new DocumentDbSagaRepository(documentDbClient, \"sagaDatabase\");\n\nIf you use a container, you can use the code like this (example for Autofac):\nbuilder.RegisterInstance(new DocumentClient(endpointUri, authKeyString))\n    .As();\nbuilder.Register(c => \n        new DocumentDbSagaRepository(c.Resolve(), \"sagaDatabase\"))\n    .As>()\n    .SingleInstance();\n\nAzure Service Bus\nAzure Service Bus provides a feature called message sessions, to process multiple messages at once and to store some state on a temporary basis, which can be retrieved by some key.\nThe latter give us an ability to use this feature as saga state storage. Using message sessions as saga persistence, you can only use Azure Service Bus for both messaging and saga persistence purposes, without needing any additional infrastructure.\nThere is a limitation for using message sessions - this feature is not supported for AMQP transport.\nYou have to explicitly enable message sessions when configuring the endpoint, and use parameterless constructor to instantiate the saga repository.\nHere is the basic sample of how to use the Azure Service Bus message session as saga repository:\nvar sagaStateMachine = new MySagaStateMachine();\nvar repository = new MessageSessionSagaRepository(); \nsbc.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"test_queue\", ep =>\n{\n    ep.RequiresSession = true;\n    ep.StateMachineSaga(sagaStateMachine, repository);\n});\n\nAs mentioned before, the message session allows storing and retrieving any state by some unique key. This means that this type of saga persistence only support correlation by id. So, similar to Redis saga persistence, you cannot use CorrelateBy to specify how to find the saga instance, but only CorrelateById.\nDapper\nProvides persistence for MSSQL using Dapper.\nDapper.Contrib is used for inserts and updates. The methods are virtual, so if you'd rather write the SQL yourself it is supported.\nIf you do not write your own sql, the model requires you use the ExplicitKey attribute for the CorrelationId. And if you have properties that are not available as columns, you can use the Computed attribute to not include them in the generated SQL.\npublic class SampleSaga : ISaga\n{\n    [ExplicitKey]\n    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public string State { get; set; }\n\n    [Computed]\n    public Expression> CorrelationExpression\n    {\n        get { return (saga, message) => saga.Name == message.Name; }\n    }\n}\n\nLimitations\nThe tablename can only be the pluralized form of the class name. So SampleSaga would translate to table SampleSagas. This applies even if you write your own SQL for updates and inserts.\nThe expressions you can use for correlation is somewhat limited. These types of expressions are handled:\n    x => x.CorrelationId == someGuid;\n    x => x.IsDone;\n    x => x.CorrelationId == someGuid && x.IsDone;\n\nYou can use multiple && in the expression.\nWhat you can not use is || and negations. So a bool used like this x.IsDone can only be handled as true and nothing else.\nDapper does not yet support strong naming, though it is being worked on.\nAlso this does not support dotnetcore yet.\n"},"advanced/courier/":{"url":"advanced/courier/","title":"Courier","keywords":"","body":"Using Courier\nDeveloping applications using a distributed, message-based architecture significantly increases the complexity of performing operations transactionally, where an end-to-end set of steps must be completed entirely, or not at all. In an application using an ACID database, this is typically done using SQL transactions, where partial operations are rolled back if the transaction cannot be completed. However, this doesn't scale when the steps being to include dependencies outside of a single database. And in the distributed, microservices based architectures, the use of a single ACID database is shrinking to completely non-existent.\nMassTransit Courier is a mechanism for creating and executing distributed transactions with fault compensation that can be used to meet the requirements previously within the domain of database transactions, but built to scale across a large system of distributed services. Courier also works well with MassTransit sagas, which add transaction monitoring and recoverability.\nUsing a Routing Slip\nA routing slip specifies a sequence of processing steps called activities that are combined into a single transaction. As each activity completes, the routing slip is forwarded to the next activity in the itinerary. When all activities have completed, the routing slip is completed and the transaction is complete.\nA key advantage to using a routing slip is it allows the activities to vary for each transaction. Depending upon the requirements for each transaction, which may differ based on things like payment methods, billing or shipping address, or customer preference ratings, the routing slip builder can selectively add activities to the routing slip. This dynamic behavior is in contrast to a more explicit behavior defined by a state machine or sequential workflow that is statically defined (either through the use of code, a DSL, or something like Windows Workflow).\nMassTransit Courier\nMassTransit Courier is a framework that implements the routing slip pattern. Leveraging a durable messaging transport and the advanced saga features of MassTransit, Courier provides a powerful set of components to simplify the use of routing slips in distributed applications. Combining the routing slip pattern with a state machine such as Automatonymous results in a reliable, recoverable, and supportable approach for coordinating and monitoring message processing across multiple services.\nIn addition to the basic routing slip pattern, MassTransit Courier also supports compensations which allow activities to store execution data so that reversible operations can be undone, using either a traditional rollback mechanism or by applying an offsetting operation. For example, an activity that holds a seat for a patron could release the held seat when compensated.\n\nActivities\nBuilder\nExecution\nEvents\nSubscriptions\n\n"},"advanced/courier/activities.html":{"url":"advanced/courier/activities.html","title":"Activities","keywords":"","body":"Activities\nIn MassTransit Courier, an Activity refers to a processing step that can be added to a routing slip.\nTo create an activity, create a class that implements the Activity interface.\npublic class DownloadImageActivity :\n    Activity\n{\n    Task Execute(ExecutionContext context);\n    Task Compensate(CompensateContext context);\n}\n\nThe Activity interface is generic with two arguments. The first parameter specifies the activity’s argument type and the second parameter specifies the activity’s log type. In the example shown above, DownloadImageArguments is the argument type and DownloadImageLog is the log type. Both parameters must be interface types so that the implementations can be dynamically created.\nExecute Activities\nAn Execute Activity is an activity that only executes and does not support compensation. As such, the declaration of a log type is not required.\npublic class ValidateImageActivity :\n    ExecuteActivity\n{\n    Task Execute(ExecutionContext context);\n}\n\nImplementing an activity\nAn activity must implement two interface methods, Execute and Compensate. The Execute method is called while the routing slip is executing activities and the Compensate method is called when a routing slip faults and needs to be compensated.\nWhen the Execute method is called, an execution argument is passed containing the activity arguments, the routing slip TrackingNumber, and methods to mark the activity as completed or faulted. The actual routing slip message, as well as any details of the underlying infrastructure, are excluded from the execution argument to prevent coupling between the activity and the implementation. An example Execute method is shown below.\nasync Task Execute(Execution execution)\n{\n    DownloadImageArguments args = execution.Arguments;\n    string imageSavePath = Path.Combine(args.WorkPath, \n        execution.TrackingNumber.ToString());\n\n    await _httpClient.GetAndSave(args.ImageUri, imageSavePath);\n\n    return await execution.Completed(new {ImageSavePath = imageSavePath});\n}\n\nCompleting an activity\nOnce activity processing is complete, the activity returns an ExecutionResult to the host. If the activity executes successfully, the activity can elect to store compensation data in an activity log which is passed to the Completed method on the execution argument. If the activity chooses not to store any compensation data, the activity log argument is not required. In addition to compensation data, the activity can add or modify variables stored in the routing slip for use by subsequent activities.\n\nIn the example above, the activity specifies the DownloadImageLog interface and initializes the log using an anonymous object. The object is then passed to the Completed method for storage in the routing slip before sending the routing slip to the next activity.\n\nTerminating a routing slip\nIn some situations, it may make sense to terminate the routing slip without executing any of the subsequent activites in the itinerary. This might be due to a business rule, in which the routing slip shouldn't be faulted, but needs to end immediately.\nTo terminate a routing slip, call Terminate as shown.\n// regular termination\nreturn execution.Terminate();\n\n// terminate and include additional variables in the event\nreturn execution.Terminate(new { Reason = \"Not a good time, dude.\"});\n\nFaulting a routing slip\nBy default, if an activity throws an exception, it will be faulted and a RoutingSlipFaulted event will be published (unless a subscription changes the rules). An activity can also return Faulted rather than throwing an exception.\nCompensating an activity\nWhen an activity fails, the Compensate method is called for previously executed activities in the routing slip that stored compensation data. If an activity does not store any compensation data, the Compensate method is never called. The compensation method for the example above is shown below.\nTask Compensate(Compensation compensation)\n{\n    DownloadImageLog log = compensation.Log;\n    File.Delete(log.ImageSavePath);\n\n    return compensation.Compensated();\n}\n\nUsing the activity log data, the activity compensates by removing the downloaded image from the work directory. Once the activity has compensated the previous execution, it returns a CompensationResult by calling the Compensated method. If the compensating actions could not be performed (either via logic or an exception) and the inability to compensate results in a failure state, the Failed method can be used instead, optionally specifying an Exception.\n"},"advanced/courier/builder.html":{"url":"advanced/courier/builder.html","title":"Builder","keywords":"","body":"Building a routing slip\nA routing slip contains an itinerary, variables, and activity/compensation logs. It is defined by a message contract, which is used by the underlying Courier components to execute and compensate the transaction. The routing slip contract includes:\n\nA tracking number, which should be unique for each routing slip\nAn itinerary, which is an ordered list of activities\nAn activity log, containing an ordered list of previously executed activites\nA compensation log, containing an order list of previous executed activities which may be compensated if the routing slip faults\nA collection of variables, which can be mapped to activity arguments\nA collection of subscriptions, which can be added to notify consumers of routing slip events\nA collection of exceptions which may have occurred during routing slip execution\n\nDevelopers are discouraged from directly implementing the RoutingSlip message type and should instead use a RoutingSlipBuilder to create a routing slip. The RoutingSlipBuilder encapsulates the creation of the routing slip and includes methods to add activities (and their arguments), activity logs, and variables to the routing slip. For example, to create a routing slip with two activities and an additional variable, a developer would write:\nvar builder = new RoutingSlipBuilder(NewId.NextGuid());\nbuilder.AddActivity(\"DownloadImage\", \"rabbitmq://localhost/execute_downloadimage\", \n    new\n    {\n        ImageUri = new Uri(\"http://images.google.com/someImage.jpg\")\n    });\nbuilder.AddActivity(\"FilterImage\", \"rabbitmq://localhost/execute_filterimage\");\nbuilder.AddVariable(\"WorkPath\", \"\\\\dfs\\work\");\n\nvar routingSlip = builder.Build();\n\nEach activity requires a name for display purposes and a URI specifying the execution address. The execution address is where the routing slip should be sent to execute the activity. For each activity, arguments can be specified that are stored and presented to the activity via the activity arguments interface type specify by the first argument of the Activity interface. The activities added to the routing slip are combined into an Itinerary, which is the list of activities to be executed, and stored in the routing slip.\n\nManaging the inventory of available activities, as well as their names and execution addresses, is the responsibility of the application and is not part of the MassTransit Courier. Since activities are application specific, and the business logic to determine which activities to execute and in what order is part of the application domain, the details are left to the application developer.\n\nActivity Arguments\nEach activity declares an activity argument type, which must be an interface. When the routing slip is received by an activity host, the argument type is used to read data from the routing slip and deliver it to the activity.\nThe argument properties are mapped, by name, to the argument type from the routing slip using:\n\nExplictly declared arguments, added to the itinerary with the activity\nImplictly mapped arguments, added as variables to the routing slip\n\nTo specify an explicit activity argument, specify the argument value while adding the activity using the routing slip builder.\nvar builder = new RoutingSlipBuilder(NewId.NextGuid());\nbuilder.AddActivity(\"DownloadImage\", \"rabbitmq://localhost/execute_downloadimage\", new\n    {\n        ImageUri = new Uri(\"http://images.google.com/someImage.jpg\")\n    });\n\nTo specify an implicit activity argument, add a variable to the routing slip with the same name/type as the activity argument.\nvar builder = new RoutingSlipBuilder(NewId.NextGuid());\nbuilder.AddActivity(\"DownloadImage\", \"rabbitmq://localhost/execute_downloadimage\");\nbuilder.AddVariable(\"ImageUri\", \"http://images.google.com/someImage.jpg\");\n\nIf an activity argument is not specified when the routing slip is created, it may be added by an activity that executes prior to the activity that requires the argument. For instance, if the DownloadImage activity stored the image in a local cache, that address could be added and used by another activity to access the cached image.\nFirst, the routing slip would be built without the argument value.\nvar builder = new RoutingSlipBuilder(NewId.NextGuid());\nbuilder.AddActivity(\"DownloadImage\", \"rabbitmq://localhost/execute_downloadimage\");\nbuilder.AddActivity(\"ProcessImage\", \"rabbitmq://localhost/execute_processimage\");\nbuilder.AddVariable(\"ImageUri\", \"http://images.google.com/someImage.jpg\");\n\nThen, the first activity would add the variable to the routing slip on completion.\nTask Execute(ExecuteContext context)\n{\n    ...\n    return context.CompletedWithVariables(new { ImagePath = ...});\n}\n\nThe process image activity would then use that variable as an argument value.\nTask Execute(ExecuteContext context)\n{\n    var path = context.Arguments.ImagePath;\n}\n\n"},"advanced/courier/execute.html":{"url":"advanced/courier/execute.html","title":"Execution","keywords":"","body":"Executing the routing slip\nOnce built, the routing slip is executed, which sends it to the first activity’s execute URI.

While this is useful getting started, it can quickly get out of control as applications grow and multiple unrelated routing slips are used. To handle this, subscriptions were added (yes, added, because they weren't though of until we experienced this ourselves).\nSubscriptions are added to the routing slip at the time it is built using the RoutingSlipBuilder.\nbuilder.AddSubscription(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/log-events\"), \n    RoutingSlipEvents.All);\n\nThis subscription would send all routing slip events to the specified endpoint. If the application only wanted specified events, the events can be selected by specifying the enumeration values for those events. For example, to only get the RoutingSlipCompleted and RoutingSlipFaulted events, the following code would be used.\nbuilder.AddSubscription(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/log-events\"), \n    RoutingSlipEvents.Completed | RoutingSlipEvents.Faulted);\n\nIt is also possible to tweak the content of the events to cut down on message size. For instance, by default, the RoutingSlipCompleted event includes the variables from the routing slip. If the variables contained a large document, that document would be copied to the event. Eliminating the variables from the event would reduce the message size, thereby reducing the traffic on the message broker. To specify the contents of a routing slip event subscription, an additional argument is specified.\nbuilder.AddSubscription(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/log-events\"), \n    RoutingSlipEvents.Completed, RoutingSlipEventContents.None);\n\nThis would send the RoutingSlipCompleted event to the endpoint, without any of the variables be included (only the main properties of the event would be present).\n\nOnce a subscription is added to a routing slip, events are no longer published -- they are only sent to the addresses specified in the subscriptions. However, multiple subscriptions can be specified -- the endpoints just need to be known at the time the routing slip is built.\n\nCustom events\nIt is also possible to specify a subscription with a custom event, a message that is created by the application developer. This makes it possible to create your own event types and publish them in response to routing slip events occurring. And this includes having the full context of a regular endpoint Send so that any headers or context settings can be applied.\nTo create a custom event subscription, use the overload shown below.\n// first, define the event type in your assembly\npublic interface OrderProcessingCompleted\n{\n    Guid TrackingNumber { get; }\n    DateTime Timestamp { get; }\n\n    string OrderId { get; }\n    string OrderApproval { get; }\n}\n\n// then, add the subscription with the custom properties\nbuilder.AddSubscription(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/order-events\"), \n    RoutingSlipEvents.Completed, \n    x => x.Send(new\n    {\n        OrderId = \"BFG-9000\",\n        OrderApproval = \"ComeGetSome\"\n    }));\n\nIn the message contract above, there are four properties, but only two of them are specified. By default, the base RoutingSlipCompleted event is created, and then the content of that event is merged into the message created in the subscription. This ensures that the dynamic values, such as the TrackingNumber and the Timestamp, which are present in the default event, are available in the custom event.\nCustom events can also select with contents are merged with the custom event, using an additional method overload.\n"},"advanced/middleware/":{"url":"advanced/middleware/","title":"Middleware","keywords":"","body":"Using middleware\nMassTransit is composed of a network of pipelines, which are used to dispatch messages from the transport, through the receive endpoint, past deserialization, and ultimately to the consumers.

Send and publish observers are invoked after the message\nhas actually been sent.\nInstallation\nThere are two extensions methods for IBusControl that enable sent and consumed messages audit.\nConfiguring both looks like this:\nvar busControl = ConfigureBus(); // all usual configuration\nbusControl.ConnectSendAuditObservers(auditStore);\nbusControl.ConnectConsumeAuditObserver(auditStore);\n\nThere, the auditStore is the audit persistent store. Currently available stores include:\n\nEntity Framework\n\nPlease remember that observers need to be configured before the bus starts.\nFilters\nSometimes there are messages in the system that are technical. These could be some monitoring and\nhealthcheck messages, which are being sent often and could pollute the audit log. Another example\ncould be the Fault events.\nIn order not to save these messages to the audit store, you can filter them out. You can configure\nthe observers to use message filters like this:\nbusControl.ConnectSendAuditObservers(auditStore, \n    c => c.Ignore());\nbusControl.ConnectConsumeAuditObserver(auditStore, \n    c => c.Ignore(typeof(ServicePoll), typeof(RubbishEvent)));\n\nMetadata factory\nBy default, the audit logging feature uses its own, quite complete, metadata collection mechanism.\nHowever, you can implement your own metadata factories to collect more data or different data.\nThere are two types of metadata factories:\n\nDefaultConsumeMetadataFactory that gets the ConsumeObserver\nDefaultSendMetadataFactory that gets the SendObserver (which is used for both send and publish)\n\nFactories are simple classes that implement IConsumeMetadataFactory or ISendMetadataFactory\ninterfaces and return a new MessageAuditMetadata object from a given context.\nFor example, the default consume audit metadata factory implementation looks like this:\nreturn new MessageAuditMetadata\n{\n    ContextType = contextType,\n    ConversationId = context.ConversationId,\n    CorrelationId = context.CorrelationId,\n    InitiatorId = context.InitiatorId,\n    MessageId = context.MessageId,\n    RequestId = context.RequestId,\n    DestinationAddress = context.DestinationAddress?.AbsoluteUri,\n    SourceAddress = context.SourceAddress?.AbsoluteUri,\n    FaultAddress = context.FaultAddress?.AbsoluteUri,\n    ResponseAddress = context.ResponseAddress?.AbsoluteUri,\n    Headers = context.Headers?.GetAll()?.ToDictionary(k => k.Key, v => v.Value.ToString())\n};\n\nTo use your own factory, you can use the third parameter when configuring the observers:\nbusControl.ConnectSendAuditObservers(auditStore, filter, new MySendContextMetadataFactory());\nbusControl.ConnectConsumeAuditObserver(auditStore, filter, new MySendContextMetadataFactory());\n\n"},"advanced/turnout/":{"url":"advanced/turnout/","title":"Turnout","keywords":"","body":"Long-running tasks using Turnout\nMessage consumers are similar to web controllers in that they are intended to live for a short time -- the time it takes to process a single message. However, there are times when the processing initiated by a message takes long time (for instance, longer than a minute). Rather than block the message consumer and preventing it from consuming additional messages, a way to start an asynchronous task is required.\nTurnout enables the execution of long-running tasks initiated by a message consumer. Turnout manages the lifetime \nof the task, and appropriately handles failure and handing off to other nodes in the event of a server failure.\n\nWarning\n    Turnout is an early-access feature, and it's only been tested with some basic scenarios. It works, but there are rough edges, so consider it like running with scissors.\n\n\nConfiguring a Turnout\nTo configure a turnout, a turnout endpoint is created for the command message type.\nvar busControl = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = cfg.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost/\"));\n\n    cfg.UseInMemoryScheduler();\n\n    cfg.TurnoutEndpoint(host, \"audit_consumer_history\", e =>\n    {\n        e.SuperviseInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);\n        e.SetJobFactory(async context =>\n        {\n            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(7), context.CancellationToken);\n        })\n    });\n});\n\nTurnout - Under the hood\nWhen a turnout endpoint is created, the queue name specified is used to create several queues. First, the audit_consumer_history queue is created, as it is the queue specified by the developer. This is where the commands are sent, just like a normal consumer.\nA second queue, audit_consumer_history-expired is also created, and is used as the dead-letter queue for scheduled messages which are not consumed by the service. More on this in a minute, but this is used to handle node failures gracefully.\n\nNode failures such as this are still being developed, so, consider some of this forward looking. The simplest case already works though.\n\nA third queue, turnout-???, is created to allow the node to send commands to itself to supervise the state of the Task. Messages are sent to this endpoint by the node (each node gets a unique queue) using the message scheduler (this is a great place to use the built-in scheduling of Azure Service Bus, or the delayed exchange with RabbitMQ).\nJob supervision\nRather than rely on in-process timers, Turnout uses the queuing and scheduling features to supervise jobs. Messages are scheduled every interval to check on the status of the job. If the job completed, it is removed from the job registry. If it is still running, a new supervision command is scheduled. Each command is scheduled for a specific time, and the time-to-live is set to the supervision interval (plus a delta to ensure it has time to be received).\nIf the node crashes (does not cleanly shut down), the messages will not be received and will dead letter to the -expired queue. All nodes listen on that queue, and if a node receives a command that was a job being processed on another node, it will handle that as a faulted command. Since the node is typically running smoothly, the messages are consumed on time.\n\nFaulted job handling has yet to be decided, but will be configurable to either follow a retry policy, or just report that the job faulted.\n\nStopping a node\nWhen a node is stopped, any running jobs are aborted (different than being cancelled). This way, the job is reported as aborted and another node can pickup the job to continue processing.\n"},"advanced/versioning.html":{"url":"advanced/versioning.html","title":"Versioning","keywords":"","body":"Versioning messages\nVersioning of messages is going to happen, services evolve and requirements change.\nVersioning existing message contracts\nConsider a command to fetch and cache a local copy of an image from a remote system.\npublic interface FetchRemoteImage\n{\n    Guid CommandId { get; }\n    DateTime Timestamp { get; }\n    Uri ImageSource { get; }\n    string LocalCacheKey { get; }\n}\n\nAfter the initial deployment, a requirement is added to resize the image to a\nmaximum dimension before saving it to the cache. The new message contract\nincludes the additional property specifying the dimension.\npublic interface FetchRemoteImage\n{\n    Guid CommandId { get; }\n    DateTime Timestamp { get; }\n    Uri ImageSource { get; }\n    string LocalCacheKey { get; }\n    int? MaximumDimension { get; }\n}\n\nBy making the int value nullable, commands that are submitted using the\noriginal contract can still be accepted as the missing value does not break the\nnew contract. If the value was added as a regular int, it would be assigned a\ndefault value of zero, which may not convey the right information. String\nvalues can also be added as they will be null if the value is not present in\nthe serialized message. The consumer just needs to check if the value is\npresent and process it accordingly.\nVersioning existing events\nConsider an event to notify that an image has been cached is now available.\npublic interface RemoteImageCached\n{\n    Guid EventId { get; }\n    DateTime Timestamp { get; }\n    Guid InitiatingCommandId { get; }\n    Uri ImageSource { get; }\n    string LocalCacheKey { get; }\n}\n\nAn application will publish the event using an implementation of the class, as shown below.\nclass RemoteImageCachedEvent :\n    RemoteImageCached\n{\n    Guid EventId { get; set; }\n    DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }\n    Guid InitiatingCommandId { get; set; }\n    Uri ImageSource { get; set; }\n    string LocalCacheKey { get; set; }\n}\n\nThe class implements the event interface, and when published, is delivered to\nconsumers that are subscribed to the RemoteImageCached event interface.\nMassTransit dynamically creates a backing class for the interface, and\npopulates the properties with the values from the serialized message.\n\nNote that you cannot dynamically cast the RemoteImageCached interface in\nthe consumer to the RemoteImageCachedEvent, as the actual class is not\ndeserialized. This can be confusing, but is intentional to prevent classes (and\nthe behavior that comes along with it) from being serialized and deserialized.\n\nAs the event evolves, additional event contracts can be defined that include\nadditional information without modifying the original contract. For example.\npublic interface RemoteImageCachedV2\n{\n    Guid EventId { get; }\n    DateTime Timestamp { get; }\n    Guid InitiatingCommandId { get; }\n    Uri ImageSource { get; }\n\n    // the string is changed from LocalCacheKey to a full URI\n    Uri LocalImageAddress { get; }\n}\n\nThe event class is then modified to include the additional property, while\nstill implementing the previous interface.\nclass RemoteImageCachedEvent :\n    RemoteImageCached,\n    RemoteImageCachedV2\n{\n    Guid EventId { get; set; }\n    DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }\n    Guid InitiatingCommandId { get; set; }\n    Uri ImageSource { get; set; }\n    string LocalCacheKey { get; set; }\n    Uri LocalImageAddress { get; set; }\n}\n\nWhen the event class is published now, both interfaces are available in the\nmessage. When a consumer subscribes to one of the interfaces, that consumer\nwill receive a copy of the message. It is important that both interfaces are\nnot consumed in the same context, as duplicates will be received. If a service\nis updated, it should use the new contract.\n\nNote that ownership of the contract belongs to the event publisher, not the\nevent observer/subscriber. And contracts should not be shared between event\nproducers as this can create some extensive leakage of multiple events making\nit difficult to consume unique events.\n\nAs mentioned above, depending upon the interface type subscribed, a dynamic\nbacking class is created by MassTransit. Therefore, if a consumer subscribes to\nRemoteImageCached, it is not possible to cast the message to\nRemoteImageCachedV2, as the dynamic implementation does not support that\ninterface.\n\n   It should be noted, however, that on the IConsumeContext interface, there\n   is a method to TryGetContext method, which can be used to attempt to\n   deserialize the message as type T. So it is possible to check if the\n   message also implements the new version of the interface and not process as\n   the original version knowing that the new version will be processed on the\n   same message consumption if both types are subscribed.\n\nThe message is a single message on the wire, but the available/known types are\ncaptured in the message headers so that types can be deserialized from the\nmessage body.\nA lot of flexibility and power, it's up to the application developer to ensure\nthat it is used in a way that ensures application evolution over time without\nrequiring forklift/switchover upgrades due to breaking message changes.\n"},"advanced/topology/":{"url":"advanced/topology/","title":"Topology","keywords":"","body":"Topology\nTopology is how MassTransit configures the broker capabilities (exchanges and queues for RabbitMQ, topics, subscriptions, and queues for Azure Service Bus) to support sending, publishing, and consuming messages.

Note that the CorrelatedBy interface is not part of the message contract.\npublic interface OrderCreated\n{\n    Guid CorrelationId { get; }\n}\n\nIf there isn't a property named CorrelationId, the convention also checks for CommandId and EventId and uses that property to set the header value (the type must be a Guid, or a Guid?, no magic type conversion happening here). \nIf the message implements the CorrelatedBy interface, that would be used before referencing any properties by name.\nDuring bus creation, it is possible to explictly configure a message type (or any of the message type's inherited interfaces) to use a specific property for the CorrelationId.

To prevent strange things from\nhappening, developers should avoid using any static or thread static variables as these\nare one of the main causes of errors in asynchronous programming.\nThe .NET System.Transactions namespace is a static hound, with many applications following\nthe model of using a transaction scope to wrap a transactional operation.\npublic class Repository\n{\n    public void Save(Entity entity)\n    {\n        using(var scope = new TransactionScope())\n        {\n            SaveEntity(entity);\n\n            scope.Complete();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, the creation of a TransactionScope actually sets a static variable, Transaction.Current,\nto the created or ambient transaction. That word ambient should be a big clue -- it's using a static variable\n(in this case, it's actually a thread static, but anyway).\nIt turns out that the above example is simple, and works, because there are no asynchronous methods. But that\nalso means that the method blocks the thread while the database performs work (which takes an eternity in CPU time).\nMost databases support asynchronous operations (including Entity Framework), so it is logical to assume that using\nthose methods would increase thread utilization.\nIt is also often requested that a set of operations be managed as a unit of work. A single transaction is shared\nacross multiple operations that are committed as a single unit. If the commit fails, everything is undone and the\nmessage is faulted (or, retried based on the retry policy).\nSharing a transaction\nMassTransit includes transaction middleware to share a single committable transaction across any number consumers\nand any dependencies used by the those consumers. To use the middleware, it must be added to the bus or receive\nendpoint.\nBus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>\n{\n    var host = cfg.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost\"), h =>\n    {\n        h.Username(\"guest\");\n        h.Password(\"guest\");\n    });\n\n    cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"event_queue\", e =>\n    {\n        e.UseTransaction(x =>\n        {\n            Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(90);\n            IsolationLevel = IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted;\n        });\n\n        e.Consumer();\n    })\n});\n\nFor each message, a new CommittableTransaction is created. This transaction can be passed to classes\nthat support transactional operations, such as DbContext, SqlCommand, and SqlConnection. It can also\nbe used to create any TransactionScope that may be required to support a synchronous operation.\nTo use the transaction directly in a consumer, the transaction can be pulled from the ConsumeContext.\npublic class TransactionalConsumer :\n    IConsumer\n{\n    readonly SqlConnection _connection; // ctor injected\n\n    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext context)\n    {\n        var transactionContext = context.GetPayload();\n\n        _connection.EnlistTransaction(transactionContext.Transaction);\n\n        using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql, _connection))\n        {\n            using (var reader = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync())\n            {\n            }\n        }\n\n        // the connection lifetime should be managed by a container\n        // or perhaps another more specific middleware component.\n    }\n}\n\nThe connection (and by use of the connection, the command) are enlisted in the transaction. Once the method completes,\nand control is returned to the transaction middleware, if no exceptions are thrown the transaction is committed (which\nshould complete the database operation). If an exception is thrown, the transaction is rolled back.\nWhile not shown here, a class that provides the connection, and enlists the connection upon creation, should be added\nto the container to ensure that the transaction is not enlisted twice (not sure that's a bad thing though, it should be\nignored). Also, as long as only a single connection string is enlisted, the DTC should not get involved. Using the same\ntransaction across multiple connection strings is a bad thing, as it will make the DTC come into play which slows the\nworld down significantly.\n"},"advanced/interoperability.html":{"url":"advanced/interoperability.html","title":"Interoperability","keywords":"","body":"Interoperability\nIn MassTransit, developers specify types for messages. MassTransit's serializers then perform the hard work of converting the types to the serializer format (such as JSON, XML, BSON, etc.) and then back again.\nTo interoperate with other languages and platforms, the message structure is important.\nContent type\nTo support custom message types, MassTransit uses a transport-level header to specify the message format.

The IV itself is not a secret, it acts as a salt and is written to the first 16 bytes of the encrypted message so that it can be used to decrypt the message on the other side.\nSymmetric Key\nMassTransit uses a default built in ConstantSecureKeyProvider allowing you to use a constant key for encrypting all your messages, this takes in a array of bytes to be used when encrypting the messages.\nHowever, if required you can implement your own ISecureKeyProvider, this is useful when you want to use a 3rd party key provider like AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault. Using a 3rd party like AWS KMS allows you to move the complexities of managing and rotating keys to someone else.\nGenerate a Key\nThe best way to generate a key is via C# Interactive. Start by dropping in to the Developer Command Prompt for VS, this can be achieved via the Start Menu or by executing the following from the Run Dialog ([Windows]+[R]).\ncmd.exe /k \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Professional\\Common7\\Tools\\VsDevCmd.bat\"\n\nOnce in command prompt, run the C# Interactive (csi.exe) then run the following statements to generate a key.\n> using System.Security.Cryptography;\n> var aes = new AesCryptoServiceProvider();\n> aes.GenerateKey()\n> aes.Key\nbyte[32] { 115, 171, 121, 43, 89, 24, 199, 205, 23, 221, 178, 104, 163, 32, 45, 84, 171, 86, 93, 13, 198, 132, 38, 65, 130, 192, 6, 159, 227, 104, 245, 222 }\n\nIf you want a text representation of the key, you can Base64 encode the key which can then be store in your App.Config or appsettings.json.\n> var base64Key = Convert.ToBase64String(aes.Key);\n> base64Key\n\"c6t5K1kYx80X3bJooyAtVKtWXQ3GhCZBgsAGn+No9d4=\"\n\n\nNote that once you've generated the keys to keep them private!\n\nConfiguration\nThe encrypted message serializer needs to be configured on the publisher and the consumer so that both sides can understand the message, this is simply done when configuring the bus.\nvar key = new []{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };\n\nvar bus = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(sbc =>\n{\n    var host = sbc.Host(new Uri(\"rabbitmq://localhost\"), h =>\n    {\n        h.Username(\"guest\");\n        h.Password(\"guest\");\n    });\n\n    sbc.UseEncryption(key)\n\n    sbc.ReceiveEndpoint(host, \"test_queue\", ep =>\n    {\n        ep.Consumer();\n    });\n});\n\nYou can also pass in your custom secure key provider in to the UseEncryption configuration method.\nvar keyProvider = new CustomKeyProvider();\n\nvar bus = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(sbc =>\n{\n    // ...\n\n    sbc.UseEncryption(keyProvider)\n});\n\nUnencrypted Message\nAfter you've configured your encrypted message serializer, MassTransit will still process standard unencrypted messages.

Depending on your application and complexity you might have a few hubs as a separation of concern for your application.

Because of this, the number of endpoints can grow quickly if you have many hubs.

If multiple receive endpoints are created,\neach should have a different queue name so that messages are not skipped.\nIf two receive endpoints share the same queue name, yet have different consumers subscribed, messages\nwhich are received by one endpoint but meant for the other will be moved to the _skipped queue. It\nwould be like sharing a mailbox with your neighbor, sometimes you get all the mail, sometimes they\nget all the mail.\nSend only bus\nIf you need to only send or publish messages, don't create any receive endpoints. The bus will automatically create a temporary queue for the bus which can be used to publish events, as well as send commands and do request/response conversations.\nHowever, this does not mean that if you need a send-only bus, you don't need to call IBusControl.StartAsync() (or Start()). The temporary queue only gets created when you start the bus.\nHow do I load balance consumers across machines?\nTo load balance consumers, the process with the receive endpoint can be hosted on multiple servers.\nAs long as each receive endpoint has the same consumers registered, the messages will be received\nby the first available consumer across all of the machines.\nWhat links two bus instances together?\nThis is a common question. The binding element, really is the\nmessage contract. If you want message A, then you subscribe to\nmessage A. The internals of MT wires it all together.\nWhy aren't queue / message priorities supported?\nMessage Priorities are used to allow a message to jump to the front\nof the line. When people ask for this feature they usually have multiple\ntypes of messages all being delivered to the same queue. The problem\nis that each message has a different SLA (usually the one with the\nshorter time window is the one getting the priority flag). The problem\nis that w/o priorities the important message gets stuck behind the\nless important/urgent ones.\nThe solution is to stop sharing a single queue, and instead establish\na second queue. In MassTransit you would establish a second instance\nof IServiceBus and have it subscribe to the important/urgent\nmessage. Now you have two queues, one for the important things and one\nfor the less urgent things. This helps with monitoring queue depths,\nerror rates, etc. By placing each IServiceBus in its own Topshelf host\n/ process you further enhance each bus's ability to process messages, and\nisolate issues / downtime.\nRequest client throws a timeout exception\nMassTransit uses a temporary non-durable queue and has a consumer to handle responses. This temporary queue only get configured and created when you start the bus. If you forget to start the bus in your application code, the request client will fail with a timeout, waiting for a response.\nReading\nhttp://www.udidahan.com/2008/01/30/podcast-message-priority-you-arent-gonna-need-it/\nhttp://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2010/11/18/queues-are-still-queues/\nI want to know if another bus is subscribed to my message.\n\nSo, if you try to program this way, you're going to have a bad time. ;)\n\nKnowing that you have a subscriber is not the concern of your application.\nIt is something the system architect should know, but not the application.\nMost likely, we just need to introduce all of the states in our protocol\nmore explicitly, by using a Saga.\n"},"troubleshooting/show-config.html":{"url":"troubleshooting/show-config.html","title":"Diagnostics","keywords":"","body":"Displaying configuration\nA bus instance is composed of many classes, all of which are wired together to form a connection pipeline of\nmessage processing goodness.

While certainly not required reading to use MassTransit, they may offer\nsome insight into the why's and what's of how things are done.\n\nGreen Cache\n\n"},"architecture/green-cache.html":{"url":"architecture/green-cache.html","title":"Green Cache","keywords":"","body":"Green Cache\nCaching has long been a requirement for building fast systems, including microprocessors, file systems, databases, the internet, and even developer applications. Typically, trading a little memory for increased performance is a good thing - applications respond more quickly which leads to happy users.\nMassTransit has tried a few different ways to cache things like send endpoints, to reduce the load on the broker and minimize application latency when sending messages. They've all sort of worked, but I really wanted to come up with a way to avoid duplicate work and also avoid cascade failures by caching failures. I also wanted to make sure highly dynamic systems that heavily use temporary queues don't run out of channels by keeping too many send endpoints cached that are only used once.\nTo that end, I created Green Cache.\nCache Architecture\nGreen Cache is an in-memory, asynchronous, least-recently-used (LRU) cache optimized for indexed access to cached values. When using Green Cache, an index is used to read from the cache, with values added via a missing value factory which can be provided to the Get operation. The cached values are held within the address of a single process, and are accessed directly by the code running in that process.\n\nThis type of cache is very fast, requires no serialization, and is well suited for creating connection pools, session pools, and for maintaining handles to resources.\n\nGreen Cache is composed of a node tracker that keeps track of cached values which is then shared by the cache's indices. Each index has a key (that is strongly typed) which is a property on the cached value, that is the unique identity for the value.\nAsynchronous, for the, await for it, win!\nCached values are read using an index, and that read operation is fully asynchronous. The Get method shown below has two key aspects that make it a really powerful abstraction for this type of cache.\nTask Get(TKey key, MissingValueFactory factory);\n\nFirst the key, which should be obvious. If it were a string, a string would be provided to find the value using the index. The second argument is a factory method to create the value if it isn't found. This delegate is asynchronous as well, and is only called if the value is not found.\npublic delegate Task MissingValueFactory(TKey key);\n\nThe compositional nature of the TPL makes this a really strong abstraction -- the Task returned by the Get method above is not the same task that is returned from the missing value factory. In order to make cache access quick, the Task returned is a placeholder which is decoupled from the factory method. This placeholder reserves an index slot for the key specified, while the factory method is invoked asynchronously.\nAdding the key to the index allows subsequent reads for the same key to receive the same placeholder as the first read -- preventing duplicate factory methods being executed. The factory methods for these reads aren't lost, however, and are stored by the placeholder in the order they were received. This approach makes it possible for dozens of tasks to wait on the creation of the value for the same key to be returned.\nA subsequent reader for the same key may receive one of the following results:\n\nThe value created by the first reader, if the factory method ran to completion.\nThe value created by a subsequent reader that called Get before this reader.\nThe value created by the factory method provided by this reader.\nThe value, if the factory method ran to completion\nA faulted task, only if the factory method provided by this reader throws an exception. This fault would only be visible to this reader, any subsequent readers would not see this exception.\n\n\n\nIf a subsequent reader does not provide a missing value factory, the reader will receive one of the following results:\n\nThe value created by a previous reader, if any previous reader's factory method ran to completion.\nA KeyNotFoundException if no previous reader's factory method ran to completion (either cancelled or faulted).\n\nOnce the value has been created, the placeholder is replaced with a cached node by the node tracker. If the cache has multiple indices, the value is then propagated to the other indices, making it available to readers.\n\nAn index by itself is consistent, you can read cached values and they'll exist once created, but there is no guarantee that another index will have the value until after it has been created and propagated.\n\nRecycling (staying Green)\n\nA cache without an eviction policy is a memory leak.\n\nGreen Cache uses two methods for managing memory usage, a capacity limit combined with an age limit.\nThe capacity limit specifies how many values can be stored in the cache. The cache capacity is dynamic and doesn't represent a fixed limit how many values are in the cache at a point in time. Instead, capacity works in combination with the minimum age to make the cache useful for short-lived values, while keeping the size of the cache under control long term.\nThe age limits define the minimum and maximum age of a value. The minimum age is a fixed lower limit specifying how long a value is cached, and a value will never be removed until it is of legal age. The maximum age is the longest an untouched value will remain in the cache before being removed.\n\nYes, if you add one hundred million values per minute to a cache with a capacity of 1000, you will have one hundred meeellllion values in your cache for a minute.\n\nUnder the hood\nTo manage values, a node tracker determines the overall potential lifespan of a value (basically the difference between the maximum and minimum age) and splits that time period into buckets. The buckets are arranged in order by time, and accesses the buckets using a ring (which sounds really cool, but it's just using the % operator to avoid reusing a bucket index).\nAs time passes, the active range of buckets moves forward. Once the cache capacity has been reached, older buckets are emptied to make room for new values.\nValues within a bucket can be touched, so that even if they are legally old enough to be removed from the cache they'll remain and be moved to the current bucket. This ensures that lively values are kept in the cache longer than cold fish. \nThe node tracker also have a maximum lifetime before it essentially drops everything and restarts. The reason for this is to avoid weird things that happen when a cache lives forever and to allow the process memory structure a reboot to avoid long-term garbage collection issues. The reason for this is simple -- years of building services that run 24x7 and seeing weird things magically fix themselves after restarting the service.\nWrap up\nThat's about it for now. For MassTransit developers, this doesn't change anything on the surface as it is completely internal. I just found it interesting enough to share, both to get feedback and to come to some mental conclusion after the time spent creating Green Cache.\n"}}}
