# Samples

Samples are a great way to learn about MassTransit features. By seeing a feature used in a working application, it makes it easier to explore and understand. A developer can clone the repository, openthe solution in Visual Studio, and walk through the code.

The new samples are standalone repositories, which use NuGet to pull dependencies exactly as a developerwould use MassTransit.

The samples are described in the following sections.

* [Request/Response](request-response.md)
* [Saga](saga.md)
* [Courier](courier.md)
* [Containers](containers.md)
* [Quartz](quartz.md)
